# Inspector Rupert Hesslewick

Rupert Hesslewick is a man carved out of fatigue and precision—tall, gaunt, with a spine like a yardstick and a face that hasn’t smiled without irony since 1923. At 64, he is officially retired from the Metropolitan Police, but the uniform never quite left his bearing. He lives in a slate-roofed cottage on the edge of Marlinghurst, with his one-eyed bulldog, Bixby, and a bookcase of forensic journals kept in meticulous alphabetical order, even if the rest of the house reeks of damp and forgotten laundry.

Hesslewick came up through the ranks in the smoke and blood of London’s interwar underbelly. Child murders in Deptford, political bombings in Whitechapel, and a string of poisonings in Clerkenwell that earned him a DCI badge—and fifteen years of poor sleep. His mind is precise but unkind to itself: he forgets nothing, forgives less, and wakes most nights at 3:12 a.m., breath caught in the trench-gas nightmares that followed him home from the Somme.

He drinks, yes—but not publicly. A bottle of fine whiskey kept under the sink, always three fingers' worth gone. Not to forget, but to mute the spaces between thoughts.

Socially, he is solitary without being unfriendly. Children avoid him instinctively, dogs not at all. He has no family, no living relatives, and no illusions about the village’s view of him: tolerated, useful, vaguely unsettling. His conversation is dry, aphoristic, sometimes surgical. He does not gossip, but he listens. He knows who cheats at whist, who receives unmarked letters from Brighton, and which garden shed contains more than tools.

Hesslewick’s relationship with PC Griggs is informal but essential. Griggs provides access, plausible deniability, and a kind of rural ballast; Hesslewick brings method, menace, and memory. He rarely enters a room without observing where the light falls and where the dust doesn't. He does not like assumptions. He does not like mess. He does not believe in coincidence.

He keeps a file of unsolveds in a desk drawer locked with a key tied to his dog’s collar.

When asked why he didn’t leave it all behind, Hesslewick once said:
"If I stop working, the things I remember will be the only things I am."
He meant it.

# How He Investigates

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick investigates like a man disassembling a pocket watch—not with speed, but with relentless exactness. His method is slow, deliberate, and shaped more by accumulated pressure than by sudden inspiration.

## Investigative Style

1. Observational Persistence

He doesn't just see a room—he notes what's not there. A closed curtain in daylight, two teaspoons for a single cup, or a book returned to the wrong shelf. He walks crime scenes in silence, hands behind his back, committing not just objects but atmospheres to memory. If a room feels “wrong,” he stays until he understands why.

2. Psychological Pressure

Hesslewick rarely confronts directly. He prefers to ask precise, quiet questions in unremarkable moments—during a walk, over tea, just as someone’s guard lowers. He doesn’t accuse; he suggests a narrative and watches who flinches. His tone is gentle, his conclusions rarely voiced aloud—until they need to be.

3. Pattern Recognition Over Evidence

He distrusts theory, but he trusts rhythm. If three things happen in similar ways, he looks for the fourth. He once solved a double drowning because both victims wore wool socks in August. In the city, this made him brilliant. In the village, it makes him unnerving.

4. Uses Griggs Tactically

Griggs is the visible presence: the uniform, the official inquiry. Hesslewick uses him as a screen to move behind—he watches how people behave when Griggs is near, what they hold back, and what slips out when they assume the “real” policeman has already asked the important questions.

5. Compulsive Notebooking

He carries a battered leather notebook—filled with timelines, quotations, sketches of floorplans, and occasional fragments of war poetry. Not for show; it’s how he thinks. He flips through it mid-conversation without apology.

6. Memory as Weapon

He remembers details most forget: an odd verb choice, the direction of cigarette ash, who opened a window and who said they didn’t. When someone lies, he often doesn’t correct them—just files it away for the moment when it will hurt most.

## Ethos

He doesn’t believe in justice, exactly. He believes in truth, even if it rots the community from the inside. He doesn’t care if it ruins a reputation, ends a marriage, or uncovers something no one asked to know. The truth is the only thing left that he trusts.

He never says it, but he investigates like he's still on the battlefield—each lie a potential landmine, each silence a sniper in cover. And like all good soldiers, he assumes the real danger is never where you're told to look.
