# Thornley Garth Village

Thornley Garth lies half a mile from the cliff-edge, hemmed in by hawthorn hedgerows and a ribbon of chalk road last resurfaced before the Great War. The village straddles the boundary between fading agrarian tradition and creeping modernism, uneasily balanced between horse-plough and radio mast.

The population—just over 500—is stratified but interdependent. Class lines remain sharp, but necessity has softened the edges. Thornley Garth survives on legacy: dwindling orchards, seasonal lettings, and pensions.

National anxieties ripple through its routines. The Coronation brought bunting but little real joy. Oswald Mosley has no declared supporters here, but his name has been heard in the back room of the pub, always in lowered voices. Meanwhile, Brighton grows nearer each year: the bus now runs twice daily, bringing day-trippers, reformers, and the occasional political pamphlet.

There is no police station—only PC Griggs, a war veteran with poor hearing and a deep distrust of anything not grown in Sussex soil. Everyone knows everyone, but no one knows everything—and that remains the village’s most valuable currency.
