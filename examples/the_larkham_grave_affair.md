## Narrative

Scene 1: The Churchyard at Dawn

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at St. Agnes churchyard as the mist lifted, boots sinking into churned earth beside Mrs. Edith Larkham’s grave. The headstone leaned, and the grave looked as though a badger had attempted a midnight excavation. PC Griggs hovered nearby, notebook in hand, uneasy.

Hesslewick surveyed the scene, noting the absence of professional tools—just a battered spade abandoned in the grass, its handle sticky with mud. The grave’s contents were disturbed, the coffin lid prised open. Mrs. Larkham’s wedding band, silver locket, and ivory-handled prayer beads were missing. The theft was clumsy, desperate, and personal.

Scene 2: The Suspects Assemble

By mid-morning, the vicarage drawing room was crowded. Agnes Larkham, the late Mrs. Larkham’s daughter, sat upright, eyes red-rimmed. Mr. Willoughby, the churchwarden, polished his spectacles with a worn handkerchief. Tommy Bristow, a wiry young man with dirt beneath his fingernails, slouched in a corner. Mrs. Hilda Fenwick, the village chronicler, perched on a chair’s edge, lips pursed. Reverend Samuel Pritchard presided, his cassock frayed at the cuffs.

Hesslewick began with pleasantries. He asked each for their whereabouts the previous night. Willoughby claimed to have been at home, reading. Agnes admitted to visiting her mother’s grave at dusk, leaving before dark. Tommy said he was at the taproom until closing. Mrs. Fenwick said she’d been taking her evening walk near the churchyard. Reverend Pritchard said he’d been preparing Sunday’s sermon.

Scene 3: The Interviews

Hesslewick spoke with Agnes first. She twisted her handkerchief, voice trembling. “I only wanted to say goodnight. I left flowers. Everything was as it should be.”

Mr. Willoughby, summoned next, seemed affronted. “A disgrace, Inspector. Edith was a pillar. I was at home all night—ask my housekeeper. I locked the church at six.”

Tommy Bristow, when pressed, grew defensive. “I’ve no use for trinkets. I was at the taproom. Ask anyone. Besides, I wouldn’t know how to open a coffin.”

Mrs. Fenwick, eyes bright, leaned in. “I saw Agnes at the grave, poor girl. And Tommy skulking about the lychgate, though he’ll deny it. As for me, I enjoy the evening air.”

Reverend Pritchard, last, looked weary. “The church’s finances are strained, yes, but I would never stoop to such a thing. Edith was a friend.”

Scene 4: The Clues and the Calm

Hesslewick walked the churchyard again, noting the spade’s size—too large for a woman’s hand, but the handle bore a faded blue ribbon. He found a single muddy footprint on the path, smaller than his own. He paused by the lychgate, where the grass was flattened as if someone had waited there.

Back in the vicarage, Mrs. Fenwick recounted, “I heard a bell at midnight—must have been the wind. Or perhaps the church clock, though it hasn’t chimed in weeks.”

Tommy, when asked about the spade, shrugged. “Could be anyone’s. Folk borrow tools all the time.”

Agnes, quietly, said, “Mother’s locket was always hard to open. The clasp sticks. I doubt a stranger would manage it.”

Scene 5: The Puzzle

As dusk fell, Hesslewick gathered the villagers in the nave. He recited the facts. The grave was disturbed after dark. The theft required no special skill, only desperation. The spade was borrowed, not owned. The locket’s clasp was tricky. Someone had lingered by the lychgate. And someone had knowledge they should not have had.

He closed his notebook. “The truth is here, if one cares to see it.”

Why does Hesslewick suspect one of the villagers? What detail does not fit? What has he realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key clue is Mrs. Fenwick’s statement: “I heard a bell at midnight—must have been the wind. Or perhaps the church clock, though it hasn’t chimed in weeks.” Only someone who was in the churchyard at midnight could have heard any bell, real or imagined. The church clock is broken, and no bell would have sounded. Mrs. Fenwick’s knowledge of the time and her presence near the churchyard at the critical hour contradict her claim of merely taking a walk at dusk. Additionally, the spade bore a blue ribbon—Mrs. Fenwick is known for tying ribbons to her gardening tools, a detail observed by Hesslewick in her own garden. The muddy footprint was small, matching her shoe size. The locket’s tricky clasp would have been familiar to Agnes, but Agnes had no reason to linger by the lychgate. Mrs. Fenwick, eager for gossip and perhaps hoping to find something valuable, was the only one with both the opportunity and the inadvertent knowledge that betrayed her. Hesslewick deduced her guilt from her knowledge of the bell and the ribbon on the spade, eliminating the others by their lack of access, motive, or opportunity at the crucial time.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, well-paced, and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, and their roles in the community are clear. The clues are woven into the story naturally, and the dialogue is appropriate for the period. The addition of the detective’s notes deepens immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle. The narrative avoids modern anachronisms and maintains a tone fitting for a classic cosy crime.

The suspects are introduced neutrally, and their alibis and personalities are presented without bias. The clues—the blue ribbon, the muddy footprint, the knowledge of the bell—are present but not overtly highlighted, preserving the puzzle for the reader.

The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider motive, opportunity, and contradiction without leading them to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue is Mrs. Fenwick’s knowledge of the bell at midnight, which she could not have heard unless she was present at the scene. The blue ribbon on the spade and the small footprint further implicate her. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The only minor point is the spade’s size being described as too large for a woman’s hand, yet Mrs. Fenwick is the culprit; however, this is mitigated by the presence of the ribbon and the footprint, and it is plausible that she could have used it despite its size.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to detail and inference, but all necessary information is present and fairly clued. It should provide a satisfying challenge for most readers.
