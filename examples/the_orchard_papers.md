## Narrative

The morning after the storm, Thornley Garth woke to a scandal: the grave of Edwin Latchford, late orchard owner, had been disturbed. The churchyard, usually a haven of moss and silence, was now a scene of whispered speculation. The lychgate’s lock, supposedly secure overnight, hung open. A broken lantern lay in the grass, its glass scattered like teeth. Muddy footprints, half-erased by rain, led away toward the chalk road.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived before breakfast, his coat buttoned to the throat, notebook already in hand. He surveyed the grave—earth clumsily replaced, coffin prised open. Missing: Edwin’s signet ring and a sheaf of legal documents rumoured to determine the fate of the Latchford orchard. The theft, it was agreed, had occurred in the small hours. The churchyard gate should have been locked. It was not.

He began with Agnes Latchford, the widow, who stood by the yew tree, black-gloved and dry-eyed. She admitted the orchard’s future was uncertain. Her late husband’s will, she said, was clear—unless, of course, the missing documents said otherwise. She had spent the night at home, she insisted, with her housekeeper as witness. She did not care for Harold Bexley, Edwin’s business partner, who had pressed her to sell the orchard outright. She did not care for Tommy Snipe, either, who had offered to buy the land for a sum she called ‘insulting.’

Harold Bexley arrived in a flurry of apologies and mud-spattered shoes. He claimed to have been at home all night, nursing a cold and a bottle of brandy. He had quarreled with Edwin, yes, but only over business. He had no key to the churchyard, he said, and little patience for village gossip. He eyed Agnes with something like resentment.

Mabel Griggs, daughter of PC Griggs and part-time caretaker, was pale and anxious. She had locked the gate at dusk, she said, and checked it twice. She had seen nothing amiss when she left at half past eight. She had spent the night at home, reading by the fire. She was certain she had not lost her keys. She did not like Tommy Snipe, who had once tried to bribe her for a look at the church records.

Tommy Snipe, the rival orchard owner, arrived last, whistling and unbothered. He claimed to have been at the pub until closing, then home to bed. He had no interest in ‘old bones’ or ‘legal nonsense.’ He had, however, heard that the Latchford orchard might soon be for sale. He winked at Agnes, who ignored him. His boots were clean, his hands less so.

Hesslewick walked the churchyard, noting the broken lantern, the footprints, the gate’s battered lock. He asked Mabel to show him her keys. She produced them, all present and correct. He asked Harold about his cold; Harold coughed, theatrically. He asked Tommy about the pub; Tommy named three men who could vouch for him, though none were present. He asked Agnes about the orchard; she said she would burn it before selling to Bexley or Snipe.

The footprints, Hesslewick noted, were small—smaller than Bexley’s or Snipe’s boots. The lantern, he observed, was the sort kept in the church vestry. The lock, though battered, was not broken—merely unfastened. The rain had muddied everything, but not enough to hide the truth.

As the village gathered for the noon service, Hesslewick stood by the grave, silent, watching the mourners. He waited until the last had left before stooping to examine the earth once more. He found a scrap of cloth, caught on a thorn, and pocketed it. He made no announcement, but his eyes lingered on Mabel as she hurried away, face flushed.

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect Mabel Griggs? What detail in her story does not fit?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick suspects Mabel Griggs because her account contains a subtle but crucial inconsistency: she claims to have locked the churchyard gate at dusk and checked it twice, yet the lock was found unbroken and merely unfastened in the morning. If she had truly locked it and retained her keys, the only plausible way for the gate to be found open is if she herself unlocked it again—or never locked it at all. The muddy footprints are small, matching her stature, and the broken lantern is of the type kept in the church vestry, to which she had access as caretaker. The scrap of cloth caught on a thorn matches her coat. The red herrings—Bexley’s quarrel, Snipe’s rivalry, Agnes’s bitterness—distract from the physical impossibility: only someone with a key could have entered without breaking the lock, and only Mabel fits that description. Her nervousness and eagerness to blame others further betray her guilt. The contradiction between her story and the state of the lock is the telling clue that reveals her involvement.

## Analysis

Review of Narrative:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The language is consistent with the period, and the details—such as the lychgate, vestry lantern, and the social dynamics—are convincing. The suspects are introduced with clear motives and alibis, and the clues are presented naturally within the story. The detective’s investigative style is in keeping with the established character of Hesslewick, and the procedural elements (questioning, observation, notebook use) are well integrated.

The narrative is tight, with little extraneous detail. The inclusion of the detective’s notes at the start helps ground the reader in the facts and suspects, without giving away the solution or tipping the reader toward a particular suspect. The open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle element.

Review of Solution:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue is the state of the gate lock: only someone with a key could have left it unbroken and unfastened. Mabel’s access and her nervousness, combined with the small footprints and the matching cloth, point to her as the culprit. The red herrings are effective but not misleading. The puzzle is not trivial, as it requires careful attention to the physical evidence and the suspects’ statements, but it is solvable with the information provided.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires close reading and inference, but all necessary clues are present. The solution is satisfying and fair, with no leaps in logic or reliance on obscure knowledge. The narrative and solution are coherent, consistent, and immersive.
