## Narrative

It was the sort of April morning that made even the gravestones look hopeful, mist curling in the hollows and the rooks bickering in the yews. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at St. Jude’s churchyard with the sun barely up, his boots leaving neat impressions in the dew. The grave of Edith Maynard, freshly filled just two days prior, had been opened and resealed with a care that bordered on reverence or cunning. No valuables were missing, save for the locket rumoured to have been buried with her, a trinket said to hold both sentimental and medicinal value. The villagers, never ones to waste a good story, whispered of lanterns seen bobbing among the stones at midnight.

Hesslewick found Reverend Lionel Pritchard already at the scene, wringing his hands and muttering about sacrilege. 'It’s a stain on the parish, Inspector. Edith was a pillar, if a somewhat uneven one.' The Reverend’s eyes darted to Agnes Maynard, the deceased’s niece, who stood apart, arms folded, city shoes muddied. Agnes had arrived from London to settle her aunt’s affairs and had been heard arguing with Edith about the inheritance and the locket before the funeral.

Mrs. Hester Baines, the village healer, hovered nearby, her basket bristling with wild garlic and nettles. She claimed to have been gathering plants late into the evening for the children’s coughs and had seen nothing amiss. Tommy Griggs, the constable’s son, loitered at the lychgate, eyes red-rimmed. He was known to be close to a sick child in the next hamlet and, it was whispered, knew more about the locket’s supposed powers than he let on. Mr. Cyril Pettiford, the gravedigger, arrived last, his boots caked with yesterday’s earth. He insisted he’d left the churchyard at dusk and locked the gate behind him, as always.

Hesslewick began his circuit, notebook in hand. The grave had been opened with professional skill; the turf replaced almost seamlessly. Two sets of footprints, blurred by dew, led from the gate to the grave and back. He questioned each in turn.

Agnes, voice clipped, insisted she’d spent the evening sorting papers at the vicarage. 'I had no reason to go near the churchyard. The locket was nothing but a family myth.' Yet she flinched when Hesslewick mentioned the lanterns.

Mrs. Baines, cheerful as ever, recounted her foraging route in detail, naming every plant she’d gathered. 'I saw a light, yes, but assumed it was Cyril finishing up. I didn’t linger.' She patted her basket. 'Nothing but herbs, Inspector.'

Tommy, shifting from foot to foot, claimed he’d been at home, reading to his friend’s mother. 'I never left the house, sir. I only heard about the grave this morning.' He avoided Hesslewick’s gaze when asked about the locket’s supposed healing properties.

Cyril Pettiford, gruff and methodical, described his routine: tools locked away, gate secured, home by half-past eight. 'No one knows that ground like I do, sir. Whoever did this knew what they were about.'

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick walked the perimeter, pausing by the lychgate. The lock showed no sign of tampering. He noted a faint, sweet scent on the air, something medicinal, not floral.

By noon, the village was abuzz with speculation. The locket, if it had been taken, was nowhere to be found. The only certainty was that someone in Thornley Garth knew more than they were saying.

Inspector Hesslewick gathered the villagers beneath the yew, his gaze steady. 'Someone here has disturbed the peace of the dead for reasons of their own. The truth, as ever, is a matter of detail.'

Why does Hesslewick suspect Mrs. Baines? What detail in her story doesn’t fit? What has the Inspector realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key to the puzzle lies in Mrs. Baines’s account of her foraging. She claims to have gathered wild garlic and nettles late into the evening and saw a lantern, which she assumed belonged to Cyril Pettiford. However, the grave was expertly opened and resealed, requiring both time and knowledge—something Mrs. Baines, as a healer familiar with herbs and local lore, might possess. The real clue is the faint, sweet medicinal scent Hesslewick noticed near the grave, which does not match the pungent aroma of wild garlic or nettles but suggests the use of laudanum or another tincture—something only Mrs. Baines would carry. This scent, combined with her detailed but unnecessary listing of plants (a classic over-explanation), and her proximity to the churchyard at the relevant time, points to her involvement. The red herrings—Agnes’s inheritance dispute, Tommy’s knowledge of the locket’s powers, and Cyril’s access—are all plausible but lack the physical evidence tying them to the scene. Mrs. Baines’s slip was in providing too much detail and leaving behind the scent of her trade, which only the Inspector, with his precise nose for the out-of-place, would notice.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong period detail and a clear sense of place. The cast of suspects is distinct, each with plausible motives and alibis, and the dialogue remains natural for the era. The inclusion of the detective’s notes deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle, and the open-ended questions at the end preserve the challenge for the reader.

The narrative is tight, with little extraneous detail. The only minor issue is the mention of two sets of footprints, which could confuse readers since only one perpetrator is ultimately implicated. However, this serves as a red herring rather than a true inconsistency.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and fair. The medicinal scent is a subtle but valid clue, and Mrs. Baines’s over-detailed account is a classic sign of guilt. The puzzle is not trivial, as it requires careful attention to both physical evidence and character behavior. The red herrings are well-constructed, and the solution is neither too obvious nor too obscure.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires attentive reading and inference, but all necessary clues are present. It is challenging but solvable for an engaged reader.

Final Review:

The puzzle is well-constructed, immersive, and fair. The narrative and solution are consistent with the setting and character, and the clues are subtle but present. The difficulty is appropriate for a cosy crime puzzle, and the open-ended questions maintain the reader’s engagement. Only the ambiguity of the footprints could be clarified, but it does not undermine the puzzle’s integrity.
