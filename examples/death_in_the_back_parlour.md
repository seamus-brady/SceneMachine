## Narrative

The rain had begun in earnest by the time Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at Hargreaves’ General Store. The gaslight in the back parlour flickered, casting long shadows over the upended chair and the body of Lionel Hargreaves, slumped over his account books. The air was thick with the scent of tea and something sharper—bitter almonds, unmistakable to a man who’d seen his share of poisonings.

Mrs. Edith Hargreaves, pale and composed, stood by the window, hands clasped so tightly her knuckles shone. “I found him just after seven,” she said, voice steady but eyes rimmed red. “He was working late, as usual. I brought him his tea, then went to fetch the post. When I returned, he was—like this.”

PC Griggs hovered in the doorway, boots squeaking. Hesslewick nodded to him, then turned to the others assembled in the cramped parlour. George Pritchard, the baker, loomed near the hearth, arms folded, face set in a permanent scowl. Miss Clara Finch, the young shop assistant, perched on the edge of a stool, twisting a handkerchief. Sidney Bell, the bus driver, lingered by the door, cap in hand, eyes darting between the faces.

Hesslewick moved with deliberate slowness, noting the half-drunk cup of tea, the scattered bills, the empty rat poison bottle in the dustbin. “Who else was here this evening?”

Mrs. Hargreaves answered first. “Only us. George came to settle his account, Clara was finishing the stocktake, and Mr. Bell—well, he stops by most evenings for a cup before his last run.”

Pritchard snorted. “I was here no more than ten minutes. Paid what I owed, left straight after. Didn’t touch a thing.”

Clara’s voice was small. “I was in the storeroom, sorting the ledgers. I heard voices, but I didn’t see anything.”

Bell shifted. “I came in for tea, as usual. Mr. Hargreaves poured it himself. Edith was fussing with the post. I left before the rain started.”

Hesslewick’s gaze lingered on the tea. “Who prepared the pot?”

Mrs. Hargreaves hesitated. “I did. But Lionel poured the cups. I only brought in the tray.”

The detective walked the room, eyes flicking from the overturned chair to the dustbin. “And the rat poison?”

Pritchard shrugged. “Everyone keeps it. For the cellars.”

Clara’s hands trembled. “I never go near it. Mr. Hargreaves kept the key.”

Bell looked away. “I wouldn’t know. I’m not here for the pests.”

The evening wore on. Hesslewick questioned each in turn, his notebook filling with times and movements. Mrs. Hargreaves claimed to have left the parlour for only a minute. Pritchard insisted he never touched the tea. Clara’s alibi was the storeroom, out of sight. Bell’s was the most tenuous—he said he left before the rain, but his coat was barely damp.

As the clock chimed eight, Hesslewick stood by the window, watching the rain trace lines down the glass. He replayed the evening’s events, the movements, the words. Something did not fit. He turned to the assembled faces, his own unreadable.

“Thank you. That will be all for tonight. I shall have further questions in the morning.”

He paused, gaze settling on one of them. “But I believe I know how Mr. Hargreaves met his end.”

What detail has led Hesslewick to his conclusion?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key detail is Sidney Bell’s claim that he left the store before the rain began, yet his coat was barely damp. In reality, the rain had started well before seven o’clock, as confirmed by Mrs. Hargreaves and the state of the road outside. If Bell had truly left before the rain, his coat should have been dry. The only way his coat could be barely damp is if he left the store much later than he claimed—after the rain had already started—contradicting his alibi.

This time inconsistency reveals that Bell lingered in the store longer than he admitted. Given that he was present when the tea was poured and had access to the back parlour, he had the opportunity to add poison to the cup after Mrs. Hargreaves left to fetch the post. The empty rat poison bottle, accessible to staff and regulars alike, provided the means.

The red herrings—Mrs. Hargreaves’s distress, Pritchard’s rivalry, Clara’s argument—are all plausible motives, but only Bell’s timeline does not fit the observable facts. Hesslewick deduced Bell’s guilt from this contradiction: Bell could only have been present at the crucial moment when the tea was poisoned.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 village setting, with strong period detail and a cast of plausible suspects. The dialogue is natural and the pacing measured, in keeping with Inspector Hesslewick’s investigative style. The inclusion of the rain and its effect on the scene is both evocative and functional, providing the central clue. The suspects are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the narrative avoids overtly leading the reader to the solution. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting deduction rather than prompting a specific answer.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner consistent with Hesslewick’s character and investigative method, summarising the incident, suspects, and known facts without revealing or hinting at the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and fair, hinging on a subtle but clear contradiction in Bell’s alibi. The rain detail is well-seeded and not overemphasised, allowing attentive readers to deduce the answer. The means, motive, and opportunity are all addressed, and the presence of red herrings adds to the puzzle’s depth without rendering it unsolvable. The solution is neither trivial nor overly complex, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Assessment:

I would rate the difficulty as a 6 out of 10. The puzzle requires careful attention to detail and some inference, but all necessary information is present in the narrative. The clue is subtle but fair, and the solution is satisfying without being obvious.

Overall, the puzzle is well-constructed, immersive, and consistent with the genre and period. No major inconsistencies or errors were found.
