## Narrative

The morning after the storm, Inspector Rupert Hesslewick walked the chalk track from the pit to the orchard, his boots leaving neat impressions beside the muddle of pony hooves and cartwheels. The hedgerows were littered with broken glass and the sharp scent of spilled brandy. Near the churchyard, crates—some empty, some half-full—were stacked behind the yew, as if awaiting a congregation of less-than-saintly parishioners.

PC Griggs, red-faced and wheezing, met Hesslewick by the lychgate. "All accounted for, sir. Except the bottles what got smashed. Tommy Liddell’s in a state—found him babbling in the orchard, smelling like a distillery. Says he remembers nothing."

Hesslewick nodded, eyes narrowing as Martha Liddell approached, skirts muddy, voice clipped. "My brother’s no thief. He’s simple, not wicked. Someone’s set him up."

George Fenwick, the publican, lingered by the church wall, pipe in hand. "Odd business, this. Never saw Tommy with a taste for French spirits. But I heard wheels on the track late—could’ve been anyone."

Reverend Pritchard, grave and pale, joined them. "I discovered the crates at dawn. I fear for the church’s good name. These old smuggling tales—best left in the past."

Hesslewick began his circuit. The pony trap, borrowed from Fenwick’s stables, stood askew by the orchard. Its seat was damp, but the blanket inside was dry. A single muddy bootprint marred the step. In the orchard, Tommy sat on a crate, head in hands, muttering about shadows and voices. Martha hovered, fiercely protective.

"I never meant to take it," Tommy stammered. "Someone said there was work. Next I knew, I woke up here."

Martha glared at Fenwick. "He’s always after Tommy for odd jobs."

Fenwick shrugged. "I was at the pub all night. Ask Griggs."

Griggs nodded. "He was there, mostly. Though he stepped out for a bit—said he needed air."

Reverend Pritchard interjected, "I saw a lantern bobbing near the cliffs, just before dawn. Thought it was a fisherman."

Hesslewick jotted notes. He examined the crates—one bore a faint chalk mark, a cross. The others did not. The smashed bottles in the hedge were mostly brandy, not cigarettes. The churchyard grass was flattened in a path from the orchard gate to the yew.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick spoke quietly with each. Martha insisted she’d been home, but her apron was torn and her shoes caked with orchard mud. Fenwick grew defensive, insisting he’d only left the pub briefly. Griggs, ever dutiful, recounted the night’s events but seemed uncertain about the order of arrivals. Pritchard fretted about the church’s reputation, but knew more about the old smuggling routes than he let on.

By noon, the sun burned off the mist. Hesslewick gathered them by the churchyard. "Someone here knows more than they’re saying. The truth, as ever, is less convenient than the stories."

He paused, gaze lingering on the muddy bootprint, the dry blanket, the chalk-marked crate.

Who orchestrated the smuggling, and how did Hesslewick know?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the physical impossibility of Tommy’s story and the environmental mismatch. Tommy claims he woke up in the orchard, confused, after being told there was work. The pony trap’s seat is damp from the storm, but the blanket inside is dry—meaning someone used the blanket to shield themselves from the rain, then replaced it. Only someone who knew it would rain (and planned to be out in it) would think to do this.

Martha’s apron and shoes are caked with orchard mud, despite her claim to have stayed home. She is fiercely protective of Tommy and has debts. The chalk-marked crate is a subtle clue: it’s a sign for the real recipient, a trick known to old smugglers. Reverend Pritchard’s knowledge of smuggling routes is suspicious, but he is motivated by concern for the church’s reputation, not profit.

The real orchestrator is Martha. She used Tommy as an unwitting accomplice, sending him out under the pretense of work. She borrowed the pony trap, shielded herself from the rain with the blanket, and marked the crate for the intended recipient. When Tommy became incoherent—perhaps from drink or fear—she staged the scene to make it look like he was responsible. The dry blanket and her muddy shoes give her away. Fenwick’s absence from the pub is a red herring, as is Pritchard’s anxiety.

Hesslewick deduced Martha’s involvement by noting the contradiction between her story and the physical evidence: only someone who had been out in the orchard and used the blanket could have left both the dry blanket and the muddy tracks. The chalk mark was the final confirmation—a smuggler’s sign, not a farmhand’s mistake.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The language and details are consistent with the era, and the characters are distinct, each with plausible motives and personalities. The clues are woven into the story without being overt, and the dialogue is natural. The inclusion of the detective’s notes enhances immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle.

The narrative is tight, with minimal extraneous detail. The suspects are introduced naturally, and the physical evidence (mud, blanket, chalk mark) is presented without editorializing. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to deduce the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clues—the dry blanket, muddy shoes, and chalk mark—are all present and not overly emphasized. The reasoning is sound: Martha’s muddy shoes and apron contradict her alibi, and the use of the blanket suggests forethought and planning. The chalk mark as a smuggler’s sign is plausible for the setting. The red herrings (Fenwick’s absence, Pritchard’s anxiety) are fair and not misleading.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The puzzle is not trivial, as it requires careful attention to physical evidence and character statements, but it is solvable with attentive reading.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle requires close reading and inference, but all necessary information is present. It is challenging but fair, with a satisfying solution that rewards careful analysis.
