## Narrative

Scene One: The Discovery

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at Thornley Garth’s old orchard as dusk gave way to night. The air was sharp with moss and apple blossom. Behind the crumbling wall, Ernest Liddle lay at the foot of a lichen-streaked stone, his cap askew, a bicycle wheel spinning beside him. George Pelling, pale and trembling, stood nearby, watched by Mrs. Hatherleigh and PC Griggs.

Hesslewick surveyed the group, noting the wall’s uneven stones and muddy prints in the grass. He nodded to Griggs, who muttered about “young men and their tempers.”

Scene Two: The Statements

Pelling, wringing his cap, recounted the quarrel. “He wouldn’t give the bicycle back, sir. I only meant to scare him off—pushed him, but not hard. He stumbled, lost his footing. Next thing, he’s down.”

Mrs. Hatherleigh, arms folded, interjected. “I heard them from my kitchen. Raised voices, then a thud. I saw George run to him, shouting for help. No one else about, not at that hour.”

Mabel Liddle, eyes red but dry, stood apart. “Ernest was always borrowing, never asking. We argued this morning—nothing to do with George. He was stubborn, but not cruel.”

Scene Three: The Orchard

Hesslewick paced the orchard’s edge, notebook in hand. The wall was low but treacherous, stones slick with moss. The bicycle, a battered Raleigh, bore fresh scratches. He noted a torn scrap of cloth snagged on a branch above the wall—navy blue, not matching Ernest’s brown jacket.

He questioned Mrs. Hatherleigh again. “You’re certain you saw no one else?”

“I’d have heard them. Sound carries here. Only those two, and then the silence.”

Scene Four: The Alibis

Pelling claimed he arrived at the orchard just after seven, found Ernest already there. Mabel said she was at the bakery until half past seven, then walked home by the lane, passing the orchard only after the commotion. Mrs. Hatherleigh insisted she was in her kitchen, windows open, preparing supper. Griggs, summoned by Mrs. Hatherleigh’s call, arrived minutes later.

Scene Five: The Investigation

Hesslewick examined the bicycle. The chain was off, the pedals muddy. He asked Pelling about the torn cloth. Pelling shook his head. “Not mine, sir. My jacket’s at home.”

Mabel, when shown the cloth, frowned. “Looks like from a work coat. Ernest had one, but brown.”

Mrs. Hatherleigh, with a sniff, remarked, “Young men all dress alike these days. Hard to tell.”

Scene Six: The Puzzle

Hesslewick gathered the group by the orchard wall. He asked each to recount, once more, where they were and what they heard or saw. As dusk deepened, the detective’s gaze lingered on the wall, the bicycle, and the scrap of cloth fluttering in the breeze.

He closed his notebook. “Curious, isn’t it, how sound travels here? And how quickly a quarrel can turn to tragedy.”

He looked at each face in turn, then at the wall, then at the bicycle.

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The solution hinges on the timeline and physical evidence. George Pelling claims to have arrived after Ernest and pushed him during a quarrel. Mrs. Hatherleigh insists she heard only two voices and saw no one else. Mabel’s alibi places her at the bakery until after the incident.

The torn scrap of navy blue cloth is the crucial clue. Neither Ernest nor George wore navy blue; Ernest’s jacket was brown, and George’s was at home. The cloth matches neither. The only person unaccounted for in terms of clothing is Mrs. Hatherleigh, who is always seen in her navy blue housecoat.

Mrs. Hatherleigh’s statement is contradicted by the physical evidence: the navy blue cloth snagged above the wall suggests someone climbed over in haste. Her kitchen window faces away from the orchard wall; she could not have seen George run to Ernest unless she was outside, near the wall itself.

Mrs. Hatherleigh, known for her sharp hearing and curiosity, was in the orchard before the quarrel, perhaps eavesdropping or intervening. In the confusion, she may have startled Ernest, causing him to stumble and fall. Her insistence on hearing only two voices and seeing George run to Ernest is a deflection—she was present, but concealed her involvement.

Inspector Hesslewick deduces that Mrs. Hatherleigh’s navy blue housecoat left the scrap on the branch, placing her at the scene. Her knowledge of the sequence of events, and her attempt to direct suspicion, reveal her accidental role in Ernest’s death. The puzzle is solved by noticing the mismatch between her claimed location and the physical evidence of her presence at the wall.

## Analysis

Review of Narrative:

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, and the dialogue is plausible for the period. The pacing is tight, with each scene contributing to the unfolding mystery. The inclusion of physical evidence (the navy blue cloth) and the careful reconstruction of alibis create a fair puzzle. The detective’s presence and investigative style are well integrated, and the narrative avoids unnecessary exposition or anachronism.

The detective’s notes have been added in a manner that deepens immersion without revealing the solution or biasing the reader. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and personalities rather than hinting at guilt.

The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle, inviting the reader to deduce the solution without leading them.

Review of Solution:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction between Mrs. Hatherleigh’s statement and the physical evidence is subtle but fair. The presence of the navy blue cloth, combined with her knowledge of the sequence of events and the orientation of her kitchen window, provides a solvable puzzle for attentive readers. The motive and means are plausible, and the accidental nature of the death fits the tone of a cosy crime.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The only minor issue is that the narrative could further clarify the orientation of the kitchen window, but this is addressed in the solution. The puzzle is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for the genre.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle requires careful attention to detail and inference, making it moderately challenging but fair for experienced readers of cosy crime.
