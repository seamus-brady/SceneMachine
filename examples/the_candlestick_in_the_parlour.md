## Narrative

The fog pressed thick against the windows of Miss Edith Carroway’s parlour, blurring the world beyond into a smear of grey. Inside, the air was scented with apples and old paper. The brass candlestick, now the instrument of murder, lay abandoned on the hearthrug, its base sticky with blood. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, tall and severe, surveyed the room with the air of a man who had seen worse, but rarely in such genteel surroundings.

Miss Edith Carroway, heiress and village matriarch, was found dead at half past eight by Mrs. Agnes Pritchard, her housekeeper. The will, once kept in the escritoire, was missing. The windows were latched from within, the door left ajar. No sign of forced entry, but the village was already alive with whispers: a shadowy figure seen in the hedgerows, the last bus from Brighton, the inheritance.

Hesslewick began with Mrs. Pritchard, who wrung her hands in her apron. “I was in the kitchen, sir, polishing the silver. Miss Edith was expecting Miss Tilling for tea, but she never came. I heard nothing until I found her. It was dreadful.”

Mr. Lionel Carroway, the nephew, arrived from London the day before. He lounged in the armchair, eyes darting. “I was out walking the orchard, Inspector. Needed air after the journey. I returned just before the body was found. I saw no one.”

Mr. Harold Finch, the solicitor, stood by the window, tapping his spectacles. “I visited at seven to discuss the will, as arranged. Edith was in good spirits. I left at a quarter past. The will was in her escritoire then, I assure you.”

Miss Violet Tilling, neighbour and friend, arrived soon after the police. “I meant to visit, truly, but the fog came down so suddenly. I stayed home and listened to the wireless. I saw someone in the lane—couldn’t say who. I thought it might be Edith herself, out for air.”

Hesslewick paced the parlour, notebook in hand. The windows were latched, but the door ajar. The escritoire showed no sign of forced entry. The candlestick, heavy and ornate, was usually kept on the mantelpiece. A faint smear of wax trailed from the hearth to the escritoire. The clock on the mantel had stopped at 8:10, though no one mentioned hearing it fall.

He spoke again with Mrs. Pritchard. “You say you heard nothing?”

“Not a thing, sir. The kitchen’s at the back. I was polishing, as I said.”

“And the door?”

“I left it on the latch for Miss Tilling. She always comes by the back.”

Hesslewick nodded, then turned to Lionel. “You saw no one in the orchard?”

“Only the fog, Inspector. And a rabbit or two.”

Finch interjected, “I passed Lionel on my way out. He was coming up the drive. We exchanged a word—he seemed in a hurry.”

Lionel flushed. “I was cold, that’s all.”

Miss Tilling, when pressed, insisted, “I never left my house. The fog was too thick. I saw a figure, but it vanished into the hedgerow.”

The evening drew on. PC Griggs, red-faced and earnest, reported no footprints in the mud, save for those of Mrs. Pritchard and Lionel. The will remained missing. The candlestick, Hesslewick noted, bore a faint print of wax on its handle, unusual, as it had not been lit that night.

As the parlour clock chimed nine, Hesslewick gathered the household. “One among you knows more than they admit. The truth is here, if one only listens.”

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s deduction hinges on the timeline and a subtle contradiction in the suspects’ statements. The key clue is Mr. Finch’s assertion: he claims to have left at a quarter past seven, having seen the will in the escritoire, and says he passed Lionel on the drive. However, Lionel claims to have been walking in the orchard until just before the body was found at half past eight. If Finch left at 7:15 and Lionel was only returning at 8:30, they could not have met on the drive.

This time inconsistency exposes Finch’s lie. In reality, Finch remained in the house after his supposed departure, waiting until Edith was alone. He killed her with the candlestick, stole the will, and left by the front door, leaving it ajar. The wax on the candlestick’s handle suggests it was handled after being moved from the mantel, likely when Finch retrieved it to use as a weapon. The stopped clock at 8:10 marks the time of death, matching when Finch would have been alone with Edith.

The red herrings—Lionel’s financial trouble, Mrs. Pritchard’s resentment, Miss Tilling’s sighting of a figure—distract from the crucial point: only Finch’s story is physically impossible. The contradiction in the timeline, unnoticed by the others, is what reveals him as the murderer.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 rural English setting, with strong period detail and a clear sense of place. The suspects are introduced with distinct personalities and plausible motives, and the dialogue is consistent with the era. The fog, inheritance, and village gossip provide effective red herrings. The narrative is tight, with no extraneous scenes or dialogue, and the pacing is measured, matching Inspector Hesslewick’s investigative style.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that preserves the puzzle and deepens immersion, summarizing the key facts and suspect list without tipping the reader toward the solution. The suspects are described by their roles and relationships, not by clues or editorial hints.

The open-ended question at the end invites the reader to deduce the solution without leading them.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and satisfying. The contradiction in the timeline is subtle but fair, and the narrative provides all necessary information for a careful reader to deduce the truth. The wax on the candlestick and the stopped clock are well-used clues. The red herrings are plausible and not overplayed. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a classic cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty:

I would rate the difficulty as 7 out of 10. The puzzle requires careful attention to the timeline and statements, but all clues are present and fair. It is challenging but solvable for an attentive reader.

No major inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, period-appropriate, and logically connected.
