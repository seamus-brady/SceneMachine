## Narrative

The mist still clung to the hedgerows when Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the old cart track, his boots sinking into the chalky mud. The apple press, long surrendered to nettles and rust, stood sentinel over a scene that had already drawn half the village to the margins. PC Griggs, red-faced and sweating despite the chill, hovered near a pile of turnip sacks.

The cache—two bottles of French brandy and a clutch of silk stockings—had been found not an hour before, hastily buried beneath last year’s turnips. The goods were neither well-hidden nor undisturbed. A lantern, its wick still faintly warm, lay extinguished by the press. Muddy footprints, some broad, some narrow, led away toward the hawthorn hedge.

Mrs. Violet Harker stood apart, her gloved hands folded, eyes fixed on the horizon. She was the subject of much speculation: widowed, dignified, and lately the recipient of anonymous warnings. Arthur Pelling, the dairyman, loitered nearby, arms crossed and jaw set. His gaze flickered between Mrs. Harker and the commercial traveller, Mr. Lionel Drake, who was brushing mud from his shoes with a handkerchief that looked expensive for Sussex.

Tommy Briggs and Elsie Maynard, the farmhands who had discovered the cache, recounted their stories for the third time. Tommy, eager and wide-eyed, insisted he’d seen a shadowy figure near the press just after midnight. Elsie, sharper and less easily impressed, claimed she’d seen two figures—one tall, one stooped—arguing in hushed tones. Both agreed the lantern had been burning when they passed, but disagreed on who had left it.

Hesslewick began his inquiries with Mrs. Harker. She denied any knowledge of the cache, though admitted to receiving a note warning her to avoid the cart track. She would not say who she suspected, but her glance lingered on Arthur Pelling. Pelling professed outrage at the suggestion of smuggling, but let slip that he’d seen Drake near the press the previous evening, ‘loitering with intent, if you ask me.’ Drake, all charm and deflection, claimed he’d been at the Crown & Sceptre until closing, and had only come this way to admire the sunrise. He produced a pressed flower from his lapel as proof, though the bloom was limp and mud-spattered.

Tommy, when pressed, admitted he’d been hoping to catch a glimpse of Mrs. Harker’s mysterious visitor. He swore he’d seen a man in a dark coat slip away toward the hedgerows, but could not say if it was Drake or Pelling. Elsie, meanwhile, was adamant that she’d heard voices—one distinctly female, the other gruff and impatient. She suggested Mrs. Harker had come to meet someone, but offered no evidence beyond a muddy scrap of lace she claimed to have found near the press.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick walked the track, notebook in hand, replaying each account. The lantern, the footprints, the pressed flower, the anonymous note—each detail seemed to point in a different direction. Yet something in the stories did not fit. The cache had been found, but the question remained: who had hidden it, and who had tried to betray whom?

Inspector Hesslewick gathered the villagers by the apple press, his gaze lingering on each in turn. ‘Someone here knows more than they are saying,’ he remarked, voice mild as drizzle. ‘And one of you has made a mistake—one that cannot be explained away by mud or moonlight.’

What has the inspector realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s solution hinges on a subtle contradiction in the suspects’ stories, specifically, the state of the lantern and the pressed flower.

Elsie claimed the lantern was burning when she and Tommy passed, but the lantern was found extinguished, its wick still faintly warm. This suggests it was put out only moments before the cache was discovered. Tommy’s account, meanwhile, is vague and eager to please, but he could not have seen a figure slip away if the lantern had already been extinguished—there would have been no light to see by.

The real clue, however, is Mr. Drake’s pressed flower. He claimed to have picked it that morning while ‘admiring the sunrise,’ but the flower was limp and mud-spattered, as if it had been trampled in the night. More tellingly, the only flowers blooming near the apple press at this time of year are on the far side of the hedgerow—accessible only if one had been near the cache during the night. Drake’s alibi at the pub is undermined by the physical evidence: he could not have picked the flower that morning without muddying his shoes, and the flower’s condition suggests it was picked in haste, not leisure.

The anonymous note to Mrs. Harker is a red herring, meant to keep her away, not implicate her. Arthur Pelling’s jealousy is obvious, but his movements are accounted for by others at the pub. Elsie’s muddy scrap of lace is a distraction; it could have come from any number of garments, and she is known for embellishing stories.

Thus, Hesslewick deduces that Drake, hoping to impress Mrs. Harker with contraband, hid the goods himself but was interrupted—likely by Tommy and Elsie’s approach. In his haste, he extinguished the lantern and fled through the mud, picking up the flower as a panicked afterthought. His attempt to provide an alibi only served to incriminate him further. The mistake: the flower’s condition and location, which only the true culprit could have known.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The language is consistent with the period, and the characters are distinct, each with plausible motives and personalities. The puzzle is presented fairly, with multiple suspects and conflicting accounts, and the clues are embedded naturally in the dialogue and observations. The addition of the detective's notes enhances immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains a tight focus on the investigation. The suspects’ roles and relationships are clear, and the open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle for the reader.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and well-supported by the narrative. The contradiction regarding the lantern and the pressed flower is subtle but fair, allowing an attentive reader to deduce the culprit. The red herrings (the anonymous note, the lace, and the conflicting witness statements) are plausible and do not feel forced. The reasoning about the flower’s location and condition is particularly strong, tying the physical evidence to the suspect’s false alibi.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful reading and inference, especially regarding the timeline and physical evidence.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, relying on the reader’s attention to detail and ability to reconcile conflicting accounts. The clues are subtle but present, and the solution is satisfying without being obvious.
