## Narrative

It was the scent that lingered, long after the flames had been doused: paraffin, sharp and oily, clinging to the scorched beams of Mrs. Edith Lumsden’s rear parlour. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived just after dawn, his boots crunching on the cinders, his expression as unreadable as the soot-blackened windows. The cottage, an ivy-choked relic at the edge of Thornley Garth, had survived the night, barely. The scullery was gutted, the parlour walls streaked with smoke, but the rest of the house stood, battered but upright.

Mrs. Lumsden herself was upright too, if a little pale. She sat in her kitchen, hands folded, a cup of tea untouched before her. Her voice, when she spoke, was brisk. “I was asleep, Inspector. Woke to the smell—paraffin, yes, and smoke. I roused Mabel, and we fled. Tommy Harker was first to help. The insurance papers? I’d been sorting them before bed. Pure coincidence.”

Mabel Finch, the maid, hovered by the door, eyes rimmed red. “I sleep light, sir. Heard nothing until Mrs. Lumsden shook me. I’d no reason to be in the parlour at that hour. I—well, I’d been up late, reading. My wages are behind, but I’d never—” She broke off, twisting her apron.

Tommy Harker, summoned from the dairy, stood in the yard, hands in pockets. “Saw the glow as I came up the lane. Sprinted over, bucket in hand. Lucky I did, or the whole place would’ve gone. Mrs. Lumsden was outside already. Mabel too. Didn’t see anyone else. Smelled paraffin, strong as anything.” He grinned, showing a chipped tooth. “Not the first fire I’ve put out, sir.”

Arthur Lumsden, the nephew, arrived mid-morning, coat collar up, eyes wary. “I was at the pub till closing. Walked past the cottage on my way home, but I didn’t go in. My aunt and I—well, we’ve had words, but I’d hardly burn the place down. She’s all I’ve left, for better or worse.” He glanced at the ruined parlour, then away. “She’s been worried about money. I told her to sell the place, but she wouldn’t hear of it.”

Inspector Hesslewick walked the scene, notebook in hand. The insurance policy, recently increased, lay atop the writing desk, unscorched, oddly prominent. The scullery window was unlatched, though the rest of the house was locked tight. A paraffin can, half-empty, stood by the garden shed.

He questioned each in turn, quietly, as the sun crept higher. Mrs. Lumsden insisted she’d locked up at ten, as always. Mabel recalled hearing the wind rattle the scullery window but thought nothing of it. Tommy claimed he’d seen no one else on the lane. Arthur, asked about the quarrel, shrugged. “Family business, Inspector. Nothing more.”

By noon, the villagers had gathered in knots, trading theories. Some eyed Arthur; others muttered about Tommy’s sticky fingers. Mabel kept her distance, glancing often at her employer. Mrs. Lumsden, for her part, seemed more concerned with the insurance forms than the charred wallpaper.

Inspector Hesslewick stood in the ruined parlour, eyes narrowed. He traced the scorch marks, sniffed the air, and made a note about the window. Then he closed his notebook with a snap.

He gathered the four in the kitchen. “The fire was no accident,” he said, voice mild. “But the truth, as ever, is a matter of detail.”

What detail has led Inspector Hesslewick to his conclusion?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the scullery window. Mrs. Lumsden claimed to have locked up at ten, as always, yet the scullery window was found unlatched after the fire. Mabel mentioned hearing the wind rattle it, suggesting it was open before the fire started. However, the rest of the house was locked tight, and there was no sign of forced entry. This means the only people who could have left the window unlatched were those inside the house—Mrs. Lumsden or Mabel.

But the telling detail is the insurance policy: it was found conspicuously on the writing desk, unscorched, despite the fire gutting the adjoining scullery and smoke blackening the parlour. If the fire had started accidentally, or if an outsider had set it, the policy would not have been so carefully placed and preserved. Mrs. Lumsden, facing debts and recent costly repairs, had both motive and opportunity. She ensured the policy was safe, left the window unlatched to allow the paraffin fumes to escape and ignite, and roused Mabel at just the right moment.

The red herrings—Tommy’s reputation, Arthur’s quarrel, Mabel’s unpaid wages—distract from the physical impossibility: only someone inside could have arranged the scene so precisely. Mrs. Lumsden’s story does not add up, and her concern for the insurance forms betrays her true motive.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, tightly written, and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, with motives and personalities that fit the social structure of Thornley Garth. Inspector Hesslewick’s investigative style is well integrated, and the story maintains a sense of immersion without modern anachronisms. The inclusion of paraffin, insurance, and the locked house are classic elements of a Golden Age puzzle. Dialogue is crisp and period-appropriate. The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and keeps the focus on the puzzle.

The detective’s notes are structured, neutral, and deepen immersion without giving away the solution. The suspect list is clean, focusing on roles and relationships rather than clues.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The placement of the insurance policy, the unlatched window, and the absence of forced entry are all fair clues. The red herrings are plausible and do not feel contrived. The motive is believable for the period and character. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful attention to detail but does not hinge on obscure knowledge. The only minor weakness is that the insurance policy’s placement is a slightly familiar device, but it is handled with subtlety.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring the reader to synthesize several details and avoid being misled by plausible distractions. It is fair and satisfying for an attentive reader.
