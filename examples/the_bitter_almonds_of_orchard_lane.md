## Narrative

It was a June afternoon, the hedgerows heavy with heat, but the parlour of Mrs. Edith Lumsden’s cottage felt thick with something darker. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned from retirement by PC Griggs, surveyed the scene with the air of a man who had seen too many rooms like this. 

Mrs. Lumsden, formidable even in illness, lay pale and insensible on her chaise longue. A cup of tea—untouched, its surface still faintly steaming—sat on the table beside her. The faint scent of bitter almonds lingered in the air.

The cast in the parlour was small, as village dramas tend to be. Albert Lumsden, the nephew, hovered by the window, hands in his pockets, eyes fixed on the orchard. Mabel Carter, neighbour and self-appointed sentinel of Orchard Lane, perched on the edge of an armchair, her hat askew and gaze sharp. Dr. Fenwick, summoned in haste, checked Mrs. Lumsden’s pulse with the weary competence of a man who has seen too many ailments. Elsie Turner, the housekeeper, stood near the door, wringing her hands in her apron, her face pinched with worry—or perhaps something else.

Hesslewick’s questions were gentle, almost absent-minded. He asked about the day’s routine, the tea, the comings and goings. Elsie explained she had prepared Mrs. Lumsden’s tea at half past three, as always, and left shortly after to tend to her mother. Mabel claimed she had stopped by at four, found the door ajar, and discovered Mrs. Lumsden unresponsive. Albert insisted he had not visited his aunt that day, though his shoes bore a faint trace of orchard mud. Dr. Fenwick, called by Mabel, arrived at a quarter past four and quickly identified the signs of poisoning.

The will had been a topic of recent contention. Mrs. Lumsden had threatened to disinherit Albert after a quarrel about her pension. Mabel was known for her curiosity and habit of dropping by unannounced. Elsie, devoted but underpaid, had access to every cupboard and bottle in the house. Dr. Fenwick, though respected, had once lost a tidy sum to Mrs. Lumsden at whist and had never quite forgiven her sharp tongue.

Hesslewick paced the parlour, notebook in hand, noting the details: the untouched tea, the faint scent, the absence of forced entry. He asked Elsie about the tea—she insisted she had used the usual tin, and that Mrs. Lumsden always took it with a splash of milk, never sugar. Mabel, when pressed, recalled seeing the milk jug on the tray, but nothing unusual. Albert, when asked about his shoes, muttered something about a walk through the orchard earlier, alone. Dr. Fenwick, when questioned about poisons, remarked that cyanide was rare but not unheard of—though he could not imagine how it had found its way into Mrs. Lumsden’s parlour.

The afternoon wore on. Hesslewick, silent and watchful, let the others talk. He watched how they looked at each other, what they did not say. He noticed the milk jug, half-empty, and the faint ring it had left on the tray. He noted the unopened tin of tea, the spotless teaspoon, the way the curtains had been drawn against the sun. He listened to the rhythm of their stories, waiting for the note that did not fit.

As the shadows lengthened, Hesslewick closed his notebook. He looked at each of them in turn, his expression unreadable.

"There is something here that does not belong," he said quietly. "And I believe I know what it is."

Why does Hesslewick suspect one of the assembled? What detail does not fit? What has he realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The solution hinges on the untouched cup of tea and the scent of bitter almonds, indicating cyanide poisoning. If Mrs. Lumsden never drank her tea, she could not have been poisoned by it. The only other item consumed was the milk, already in the cup. The milk jug, half-empty and leaving a ring on the tray, suggests it was handled after the tea was poured. Mabel, the neighbour, claimed to have found Mrs. Lumsden and summoned help, and mentioned seeing the milk jug on the tray. If she arrived after Elsie had left and before Dr. Fenwick, she had the opportunity to tamper with the milk jug. The key clue is that the milk jug was not where Elsie left it, and the ring on the tray suggests it was moved. Mabel’s knowledge of the milk jug’s presence and her opportunity to add poison after Elsie left but before Dr. Fenwick arrived points to her as the culprit. The other suspects—Albert’s muddy shoes, Dr. Fenwick’s grudge, Elsie’s access—do not explain the untouched tea. Only Mabel could have poisoned the milk after the tea was poured, ensuring Mrs. Lumsden would be poisoned when she took her customary sip. Hesslewick realizes this from the environmental mismatch: the milk jug’s position and the timeline of who was present when.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 English village setting, capturing the social dynamics and period details well. The suspects are introduced with plausible motives and opportunities, and the clues are embedded naturally in the dialogue and description. The puzzle’s core—how Mrs. Lumsden was poisoned if her tea was untouched—is well constructed, with the solution hinging on careful observation of the milk jug’s position and the timeline of arrivals and departures. The red herrings (Albert’s muddy shoes, Dr. Fenwick’s resentment, Elsie’s access) are credible and do not distract from the central logic. The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative, though it requires close attention to the details about the milk jug and the sequence of events. The difficulty is moderate, as the clues are subtle but fair. The open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle for the reader. There are no major inconsistencies or errors. Overall, this is a well-constructed cosy crime puzzle with a difficulty level of 6 out of 10.
