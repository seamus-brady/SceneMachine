## Narrative

It was the sort of evening that made the parlour at Thornley Garth feel more mausoleum than drawing room: rain needling the windows, the fire sullen, and the air thick with the scent of old roses and older secrets. Mrs. Edith Lavington, family matriarch and self-appointed guardian of the Lavington name, sat upright in her favourite armchair, a half-finished cup of tea cooling at her elbow. She had been found there, quite dead, by the housekeeper, Mrs. Pritchard, at precisely half past seven. The cause: arsenic, delicately laced into her tea.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived not long after, summoned by a breathless PC Griggs. The household gathered in the parlour under his gaze: Mr. Harold Lavington, the prodigal son returned from London, his tie askew and his eyes red-rimmed; Miss Clara Lavington, pale and composed, her hands folded so tightly the knuckles blanched; Mrs. Agnes Pritchard, the housekeeper, whose loyalty to the family was as legendary as her scones; and Reverend Samuel Blythe, family friend, who had been seen leaving the house just before the tragedy.

The kitchen door had been left ajar, and one of the maids whispered of a stranger seen near the garden gate earlier that evening. Yet the rain had left no footprints, and the stranger, if he existed, had vanished into the Sussex dusk.

Hesslewick began with the tea. The cup was Mrs. Lavington’s own, a delicate porcelain with a hairline crack. Only she drank from it. The tray bore two other cups—one untouched, one drained. Mrs. Pritchard insisted she had brewed the pot herself, under Mrs. Lavington’s watchful eye. Clara had poured, as always. Harold claimed he had been in the study, nursing a headache and a glass of sherry. Reverend Blythe had taken his tea in the library, then left for evening prayers.

Clara, when questioned, spoke softly: “Mother was in good spirits. She’d received a letter, but wouldn’t say from whom. She seemed… unsettled.” Harold, shifting in his seat, muttered about business troubles and the family’s dwindling fortune. Mrs. Pritchard, eyes fixed on the carpet, admitted she’d worried about the family’s reputation—“but never enough to wish harm, sir.” The Reverend, ever discreet, offered condolences and little else, save a remark about the kitchen door: “It was open when I left. Odd, that.”

Hesslewick walked the house, noting the details: the rain-soaked path, the absence of muddy prints, the faint scent of bitter almonds in the parlour. He asked about the anonymous letter. Clara produced it from her pocket, the paper creased and trembling in her hand. The handwriting was unfamiliar, the message blunt: ‘The truth will out. Prepare yourself.’

As the evening wore on, the detective’s questions grew more precise. Why had Harold returned so suddenly? Why had Clara, so devoted, seemed almost relieved? Why had Mrs. Pritchard, loyal to a fault, been overheard fretting about scandal? And what of the Reverend, whose knowledge of village gossip was second only to his discretion?

At last, Hesslewick gathered the household. He recounted the facts: the poisoned tea, the open kitchen door, the vanished stranger, the threatening letter. Then he paused, eyes lingering on each face in turn. “There is something,” he said quietly, “that does not fit.”

What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s attention settled on the kitchen door and the supposed stranger. The rain had been steady all evening, yet there were no muddy footprints in the kitchen or parlour—impossible if an outsider had entered. The open door was a red herring, meant to suggest intrusion.

The real clue lay in the tea service. Mrs. Pritchard brewed the pot, but Mrs. Lavington always insisted on pouring her own cup, using her favourite cracked porcelain. Clara claimed to have poured, but this contradicted the established routine. Only someone intimately familiar with Mrs. Lavington’s habits could have slipped the poison into her cup before the tea was poured. Clara’s knowledge of the letter and her subtle relief at her mother’s death suggested motive: freedom from her mother’s control and the threat of scandal.

The contradiction—Clara pouring the tea, when her mother never allowed it—revealed her guilt. The stranger was a fabrication, the open door a distraction. Clara, desperate and cornered by the threat of exposure, had seized her chance. The detective’s realization: only Clara could have poisoned the tea without arousing suspicion, and her slip about pouring the cup was the fatal flaw in her story.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting, with evocative descriptions and a strong sense of place. The cast of suspects is clearly introduced, each with plausible motives and roles within the household. The dialogue and details are consistent with the period, and the puzzle is preserved by presenting facts neutrally and withholding overt clues. The inclusion of the anonymous letter and the vanished stranger adds layers of misdirection, enhancing the puzzle’s complexity. The narrative is tight, with little extraneous detail, and the pacing supports the gradual unveiling of information.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that deepens immersion, summarizing key facts and suspects without bias or leading the reader. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider the contradictions without steering them toward the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Clara’s statement about pouring the tea, when Mrs. Lavington always poured her own, is a fair and subtle clue. The absence of muddy footprints eliminates the possibility of an outside intruder, and the open door and stranger are effective red herrings. Clara’s motive is plausible, and her opportunity is established through her familiarity with household routines. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a classic cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to detail and an understanding of character routines, making it moderately challenging but fair. The misdirections are well-placed, and the key clue is subtle but accessible to attentive readers.

No significant inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, period-appropriate, and satisfying for the genre.
