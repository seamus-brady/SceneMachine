## Narrative

Orchard View Cottage, with its low beams and the scent of apples fermenting in the dusk, had seen its share of village drama, but never a supper quite like this. On the evening of Thursday, 15 July 1937, the parlour was set for five: Mr. Lionel Hesketh, his wife Edith, their estranged daughter Clara, Mrs. Agnes Willoughby (Clara’s aunt), and the housemaid, Mabel Carter, who hovered at the edges like a nervous sparrow. PC Arthur Griggs, summoned later, would remark that the only thing sharper than the cutlery was the tension.

Supper began with parsnip soup, a dish Mr. Hesketh insisted upon, though the others chose cold ham and salad. Edith served her husband herself, hands trembling just enough to rattle the spoon. Conversation was brittle: Clara’s return after years away, the ongoing custody dispute, and Mrs. Willoughby’s pointed remarks about the perils of city living. Mabel, silent, fetched bread and cleared plates, eyes fixed on the floor.

Shortly after the soup was finished, Mr. Hesketh coughed, turned grey, and collapsed. The faint scent of bitter almonds lingered in the air. Mabel ran for help; Mrs. Willoughby clutched Clara’s hand; Edith wept, her apron stained with broth. PC Griggs arrived, sniffed the air, and noted the larder door was ajar—a detail that seemed to trouble him more than the corpse.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned from Marlinghurst, arrived with his battered notebook and a gaze that left no corner unexamined. He questioned each in turn, his voice as soft as the ticking of the parlour clock.

Edith Hesketh, pale and drawn, insisted she had prepared the soup as usual, but had left the pot unattended when Mrs. Willoughby called her to the parlour to discuss Clara’s future. She returned to find the soup still simmering and the kitchen empty. She served Lionel’s portion herself, as he liked it hot.

Mrs. Willoughby, brisk and unsentimental, admitted she had entered the kitchen to fetch a jar of pickles from the larder, but claimed she never went near the stove. She said she only had Clara’s welfare at heart, and found the whole business of soup “rather provincial.”

Clara, sullen and defensive, said she had been in the garden until called for supper, and had no interest in the kitchen or its contents. She resented her father’s attempts to reclaim her, and her aunt’s interference, but denied any involvement in the meal.

Mabel, the housemaid, insisted she had only set the table and fetched bread from the pantry. She had not touched the soup or its ingredients, and had been polishing silver in the scullery when the commotion began.

PC Griggs, ever literal, noted that the larder door was ajar when he arrived, and that the faint smell of bitter almonds seemed strongest near the stove. He had little patience for “fancy theories,” but trusted Hesslewick’s judgment.

Hesslewick walked the kitchen, noting the arrangement of pots, the open larder, and a faint residue on the soup ladle. He asked Mrs. Willoughby, almost in passing, whether she had found the pickles she sought. She replied, with a sniff, that she had not—the jar was missing, and she suspected Mabel of misplacing it.

As the evening wore on, Hesslewick’s questions grew quieter, his notes more detailed. He asked Edith whether she had tasted the soup before serving it. She hesitated, then admitted she had not—Lionel was particular about his food, and she had been distracted.

The supper ended with the parlour in silence, save for the ticking clock and the distant sound of the orchard wind. Hesslewick closed his notebook, thanked the company, and left them with a single question:

What, precisely, happened in the kitchen while the soup was left unattended?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key to the puzzle lies in the timeline and the larder. Edith claims she left the soup unattended when Mrs. Willoughby called her to the parlour. Mrs. Willoughby admits to entering the kitchen to fetch pickles from the larder, but claims she never went near the stove. However, she also says the jar of pickles was missing, and blames Mabel. Yet, Mabel insists she never entered the larder or handled the soup ingredients.

The telling detail is the larder door being ajar and the missing jar of pickles. If Mrs. Willoughby truly entered the kitchen only to fetch pickles, she would have noticed the larder door was already open—or, if she opened it herself, she would have closed it after failing to find the jar. Her story does not account for the open larder, nor does it explain why the scent of bitter almonds was strongest near the stove, not the larder.

The real clue is that Mrs. Willoughby had both motive (protecting Clara from Lionel’s custody) and opportunity. She was alone in the kitchen while Edith was in the parlour. The missing pickles are a red herring: she used the pretext of searching for them to access the larder, where the cyanide was hidden (perhaps among preserves or cleaning supplies). She then added the poison to the soup while the kitchen was empty, leaving the larder door ajar in her haste. The scent of bitter almonds near the stove, and the residue on the ladle, confirm the poison was added at the last moment.

Edith’s distraction, Clara’s absence, and Mabel’s limited duties eliminate them as suspects. Mrs. Willoughby’s inconsistent story about the pickles, the open larder, and her proximity to the soup reveal her guilt. Hesslewick’s methodical questioning and attention to the physical arrangement of the kitchen expose the contradiction in her account.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting, with strong period detail and characterisation. The tension at the supper is palpable, and the personalities of the suspects are distinct and believable. The inclusion of PC Griggs and Inspector Hesslewick adds procedural authenticity, and the structure of the investigation is clear. The narrative avoids modern anachronisms and maintains a consistent tone. The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle.

The puzzle is presented fairly: the clues (the larder door, the missing pickles, the scent of bitter almonds, and the residue on the ladle) are all embedded naturally in the story. The suspects’ statements are plausible and do not tip the reader off prematurely. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle element.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and follows from the narrative. The deduction relies on the timeline, the opportunity created by Edith’s absence, and Mrs. Willoughby’s inconsistent account. The missing pickles serve as a clever red herring, and the focus on the larder and the scent of almonds is justified. The elimination of other suspects is handled cleanly. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, and it rewards careful reading.

Difficulty Rating: 7/10

The puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring attention to detail and inference from subtle inconsistencies. It is solvable with the information provided, but not immediately obvious, making it satisfying for readers who enjoy classic deduction.
