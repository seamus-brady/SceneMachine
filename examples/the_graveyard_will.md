## Narrative

Scene One: The Churchyard at Dawn

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick stood by the disturbed grave of Mrs. Edith Langridge, his boots sinking into the dew-heavy grass. The iron gate to St. Swithin’s hung open, its hinges protesting in the morning breeze. A single muddy bootprint marred the earth beside the grave, oddly solitary. PC Griggs hovered nearby, notebook in hand, squinting at the horizon as if the culprit might be revealed by sunrise.

Hesslewick’s gaze moved from the grave to the four villagers assembled at his request. Mr. Harold Langridge, nephew and local solicitor, looked as if he’d slept in his suit. Miss Clara Finch, former housekeeper, clutched her handbag with white-knuckled resolve. Reverend Simon Bell, tall and ascetic, kept his hands folded and his eyes on the church tower. Mrs. Agnes Peake, orchard owner, wore a hat with a feather that trembled whenever she spoke.

Scene Two: The Interviews

Hesslewick began with Harold Langridge, who insisted he’d been at home all night, working on accounts. “I’ve no need to rifle graves, Inspector. My aunt’s will was to be read next week. I’d hardly jeopardise my own inheritance.”

Miss Finch, dismissed only a fortnight prior, was more emotional. “I was at my sister’s in Lewes, Inspector. I left yesterday afternoon and returned this morning. I’d no reason to disturb Mrs. Langridge’s rest. She promised me the cottage, but I never saw the will.”

Reverend Bell’s tone was measured. “I locked the church at half past eight, as always. I checked the yard before leaving. The gate was secure. I cannot account for what happened after.”

Mrs. Peake, brisk and businesslike, declared, “I was pruning the east orchard until dusk. My hands are still stained, see? I heard nothing, saw nothing. If the will’s gone, it’s a family matter, not mine.”

Scene Three: The Scene Revisited

Hesslewick paced the grave. The bootprint was large, the tread unfamiliar. The gate’s latch was muddy, as if handled with a gloved hand. He noted a faint scent of pipe tobacco—unusual, as neither Harold nor the Reverend smoked. A scrap of torn fabric, dark wool, clung to the gate.

Scene Four: The Alibis Unravel

PC Griggs reported that Miss Finch’s sister confirmed her visit, but she left Lewes before midnight. The bus timetable showed she could have returned to Thornley Garth by 2 a.m. Harold’s housekeeper claimed he was home, but she retired early. Reverend Bell’s wife said he was restless, up and down all night, but she heard the church bell at midnight—odd, as it was not scheduled to ring. Mrs. Peake’s son said she came in late, muddy and irritable, but he did not see her after supper.

Scene Five: The Confrontation

Hesslewick gathered the suspects in the vestry. He recounted the facts: the solitary bootprint, the open gate, the scent of tobacco, the torn wool. He asked each to account for their movements after midnight. Harold grew defensive, Miss Finch tearful, Mrs. Peake indignant. Reverend Bell merely smiled, thinly.

Hesslewick’s eyes lingered on the Reverend’s coat—dark wool, recently mended at the cuff. He recalled Bell’s opposition to Mrs. Langridge’s burial wishes and his access to the churchyard at all hours. Yet, the bootprint was too large for Bell, and the tobacco scent was wrong for him.

The Inspector paused, then asked, almost idly, “Reverend, you said you locked the church at half past eight. Yet your wife heard the bell at midnight. Who rang it?”

Bell hesitated. “Perhaps a prank. The key is kept in my study, but—”

Hesslewick nodded, making a note. He turned to the others. “And none of you smoke a pipe?”

No one answered. The silence stretched.

Scene Six: The Puzzle

The will remained missing, the grave disturbed, the village uneasy. Hesslewick closed his notebook and addressed the group. “One of you knows more than you’ve said. The truth is in the details—if one cares to look.”

Why does Hesslewick suspect the culprit? What detail does not fit?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key clue is the scent of pipe tobacco at the grave. Of the suspects, only Mrs. Peake’s late husband was known for his pipe, and she herself never smoked. However, Mrs. Peake’s son mentioned she came in late and muddy, and she was the only one with access to her husband’s old boots—large enough to match the print. The torn wool on the gate matches the coat Mrs. Peake wore, which she claimed was snagged on a bramble in the orchard. However, the orchard has no such brambles near the gate. The time inconsistency comes from the church bell: it was rung at midnight to create a diversion, drawing attention away from the graveyard. Mrs. Peake, familiar with the churchyard from years of rivalry with Mrs. Langridge, used the opportunity to slip in, retrieve the will, and leave before anyone noticed. Her motive was to prevent the orchard from passing to a competitor. Hesslewick deduced her guilt from the combination of the bootprint size, the tobacco scent (from her husband’s old pipe, used to mask her own scent), the torn wool, and the false alibi about the bramble. The others’ alibis, though imperfect, did not fit the physical evidence as closely as Mrs. Peake’s did.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, and their personalities and roles in the community are clear. The structure is tight, with each scene advancing the investigation and providing relevant information. Dialogue is period-appropriate and avoids anachronisms. The inclusion of small, telling details (such as the scent of pipe tobacco and the torn wool) is effective, and the pacing allows the reader to absorb clues without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. The open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle element and encourage reader engagement.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that deepens immersion without spoiling the solution or leading the reader. The suspect list is neutral and focused on roles and traits, not clues. The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains coherence throughout.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The clues—bootprint size, tobacco scent, torn wool, and the false alibi—are all present and fair. The use of the church bell as a diversion is plausible and fits the setting. The motive is credible and rooted in the village’s social dynamics. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure; it rewards careful reading and attention to detail.

Difficulty Level:

I would rate the difficulty as 7 out of 10. The puzzle requires close attention to multiple small clues and the ability to connect them, but it is solvable without specialist knowledge. The misdirection with the Reverend and the subtlety of the tobacco clue add to the challenge without making it unfair.

Overall, this is a strong, fair, and immersive cosy crime puzzle that balances narrative depth with a satisfying mystery.
