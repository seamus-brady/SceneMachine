## Narrative

It was a Thursday of persistent drizzle when Inspector Rupert Hesslewick entered the back parlour of the King’s Arms, his boots leaving a faint trail on the flagstones. The room was thick with the scent of damp wool and suspicion. Five figures clustered around a battered oak table, the disputed will lying between them like a dead bird.

Miss Tansley, housekeeper and self-appointed guardian of the late Mrs. Lavington’s orchard keys, sat straight-backed, hands folded over her handbag. Mr. Harold Finch, a cousin from Hove in a suit too new for village life, hovered by the fire, eyes flicking between the will and the assembled company. Albert Lavington, nephew and local farmer, leaned against the window, arms crossed, jaw set. Mrs. Clara Bostock, neighbour and chronicler of all things Thornley Garth, perched on a stool, her umbrella dripping quietly onto the hearthrug. The fifth presence, Mr. Sidney Prowse, was a voice only—crackling over the pub’s telephone line, denying any knowledge of the will he was said to have witnessed.

Hesslewick surveyed the room, noting the orchard keys glinting on Miss Tansley’s lap, the faint ink smudge on Finch’s cuff, and the way Albert’s boots left a trail of orchard mud, though the rain had not let up since dawn. He listened as the will was read aloud: Mrs. Lavington’s signature, dated three weeks before her death, naming Harold Finch sole heir. The solicitor’s seal was present, but the handwriting wavered, uncertain.

Miss Tansley’s lips thinned. “Madam never trusted legal men. She said so to me, time and again. And she could barely see to sign her name by then.”

Finch bristled. “The will is valid. I have travelled from Hove at considerable expense. The orchard is mine by right.”

Albert snorted. “Funny, you never visited while she was alive.”

Mrs. Bostock interjected, “I recall Edith saying she’d sooner leave the orchard to the crows than to a city cousin. She never liked pens, either—always asked me to write her Christmas cards.”

Hesslewick asked each for their recollection of the day the will was supposedly signed. Finch claimed he was in Brighton, summoned by telegram. Miss Tansley insisted Mrs. Lavington had not left her bed that week. Albert remembered nothing unusual, save that the orchard gate was found unlatched. Mrs. Bostock said she saw Finch arrive at the house that afternoon, though he denied it. Mr. Prowse, on the telephone, was adamant: “I have never met Mrs. Lavington. I have not set foot in Thornley Garth in years.”

Hesslewick examined the will. The date was correct, but the ink was oddly fresh. The signature, too, bore a hesitation not present in earlier documents. He asked Miss Tansley to produce a sample of Mrs. Lavington’s writing. She did so—a shopping list, the letters large and looping, nothing like the cramped scrawl on the will.

As the rain intensified, Hesslewick questioned each in turn. Finch’s story wavered: first he claimed to have received the telegram in Hove, then in Brighton. Albert grew defensive, insisting he had no reason to forge a will: “The orchard was always meant for me.” Mrs. Bostock, when pressed, admitted she had only glimpsed a figure at the gate: “Could have been anyone, really. My eyes aren’t what they were.”

The orchard keys, Hesslewick noted, had never left Miss Tansley’s possession. Yet the will claimed the orchard was to be handed over immediately. How, then, had Finch expected to take possession?

As dusk fell, Hesslewick closed his notebook. “The truth,” he said, “is rarely a matter of ink and paper. It is a matter of who stands to gain, and who knows more than they ought.”

He left the parlour with the will in his pocket, the orchard keys still on Miss Tansley’s lap, and a single question for the company:

Who forged the will, and how did Hesslewick know?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick deduced that Harold Finch forged the will. The crucial clue lay in Finch’s knowledge of the orchard keys. Throughout the proceedings, Finch insisted the orchard was his by right and demanded the keys, yet the will specified immediate possession—impossible unless Finch knew Miss Tansley still held them. Only someone intimately aware of the household’s arrangements would know the keys had not been handed over, as this detail was not public knowledge and not mentioned in the will itself. Furthermore, Finch’s inconsistent story about his whereabouts, the fresh ink on the will, and the handwriting mismatch with Mrs. Lavington’s known script all pointed to forgery. The solicitor’s denial sealed it: Finch had both motive and opportunity, and his slip regarding the keys revealed his guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, and their roles in the community are clear. The dialogue is natural for the period, and the setting details (rain, mud, pub, telephone line) are immersive. The puzzle is preserved: the reader receives all necessary information without being led to the solution. The detective’s notes add structure and deepen immersion without tipping the reader off.

The narrative is tight, with minimal extraneous detail. The suspects’ personalities and motives are presented neutrally. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to deduce the forger and the inspector’s reasoning.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue—Finch’s knowledge of the orchard keys and his insistence on immediate possession—requires careful reading but is fair. The supporting evidence (fresh ink, handwriting mismatch, solicitor’s denial, Finch’s inconsistent story) is sufficient but not overwhelming. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable, striking a good balance for a cosy crime scenario.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires attentive reading and inference, especially regarding the keys and Finch’s knowledge. It is challenging but fair, with no silly or trivial elements. All clues are present in the narrative, and the solution is satisfying.

No inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, period-appropriate, and logically sound.
