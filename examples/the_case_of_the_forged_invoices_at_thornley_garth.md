## Narrative

It was the sort of spring morning that Thornley Garth did best: a haze of apple blossom, the faint tang of the sea, and the postman’s bicycle propped against Mrs. Larkin’s general store. Inside, the bell above the door jangled with a note of distress. Mrs. Edith Larkin, upright as a church pew and twice as unyielding, frowned at a stack of invoices. Her nephew, Tommy, hovered nearby, hands in pockets, eyes fixed on the floorboards.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived with the constable, Griggs, in tow. The store was a study in order, except for the ledger, which looked as though it had been thumbed by a nervous squirrel. Mrs. Larkin explained: several villagers had received invoices for goods they hadn’t bought, all bearing her store’s name but directing payment to Mr. Finch’s new roadside kiosk. The ink, she noted, was the same blue-black as Finch’s receipts. Finch, summoned from his kiosk, arrived with a briskness that suggested innocence or a very good breakfast. He denied everything. The invoices, he said, were a malicious trick, likely from someone with a grudge against both him and Mrs. Larkin.

Miss Clara Bell, the schoolteacher, produced her own invoice, pointing out a spelling error in her surname. She’d noticed similar slips in the school’s end-of-term reports, typed by Tommy, who occasionally helped with the school’s paperwork. Tommy flushed but said nothing. Mrs. Larkin’s lips thinned. Griggs, meanwhile, inspected the typewriter in Finch’s back room, where a half-finished ledger and a stack of blank invoices sat in plain view. The ink matched, but so did the ink in Mrs. Larkin’s store. Tommy, it was noted, had keys to both premises.

Villagers gathered outside, exchanging theories. Some whispered that Mrs. Larkin’s strictness had driven Tommy to mischief. Others eyed Finch, the outsider, with suspicion sharpened by recent price wars. Miss Bell, ever the observer, remarked that the invoices had been delivered on a Thursday, the day Tommy usually fetched supplies from Finch’s kiosk. Finch protested that he’d been in the kiosk all morning, serving customers. Mrs. Larkin insisted she’d been in the store, with Tommy, except for a brief errand to the post office. Tommy claimed to have been in the storeroom, sorting deliveries.

Hesslewick, silent as a heron, watched the interplay. He asked Finch about the ledger. Finch said he’d been updating it for tax purposes. Hesslewick noted the ink stains on Tommy’s cuffs and the faint scent of apples on Finch’s coat, a detail that seemed to amuse him. Miss Bell mentioned that her invoice had arrived folded twice, not once, as was Mrs. Larkin’s habit. Griggs, ever methodical, pointed out that the invoices were typed with a slightly misaligned ‘e’, a quirk of Finch’s typewriter, but also of the school’s old machine, which Tommy sometimes borrowed.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick took tea with Mrs. Larkin, his notebook open but his questions few. He asked about Tommy’s recent moods, Finch’s business, and the peculiarities of village loyalty. He listened, mostly, to what was not said. When he finally stood, he thanked Mrs. Larkin, nodded to Tommy, and strolled out into the sunlight, where the villagers waited for a verdict.

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect one person in particular? What detail in the narrative does not fit? What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s suspicion settles on Tommy Larkin. The key clue is the spelling error in Miss Bell’s surname on the forged invoice, a mistake she notes is identical to errors Tommy makes when typing school reports. Only someone familiar with her paperwork habits would make this error. Tommy has access to both the general store and Finch’s kiosk, and is known to use the school’s typewriter, which shares the same misaligned ‘e’ as the invoices. The invoices were delivered on a Thursday, the day Tommy routinely visits Finch’s kiosk, giving him opportunity. The red herrings—Finch’s outsider status, the ink stains, and the apple scent—distract from the behavioral slip: only Tommy would make the same spelling mistake as in the school reports. Hesslewick reasons that Tommy, disgruntled and with access to all necessary materials, forged the invoices to create trouble for both his aunt and her rival, perhaps out of resentment or a misguided attempt to prove his worth. The contradiction in the spelling is the telling detail that reveals Tommy’s involvement.
