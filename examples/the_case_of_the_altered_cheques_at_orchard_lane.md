## Narrative

It was the sort of September afternoon that made even the weeds in Thornley Garth look respectable. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, spine rigid as a church pew, stood in the parlour of Miss Edith Lavington’s cottage, eyeing the neat stacks of correspondence and the faint scent of lavender polish. Outside, the orchard sagged with apples; inside, the air was thick with the sort of silence that follows a scandal.

The crime was as genteel as Thornley Garth itself: several pension cheques, meant for the village’s elderly, had been intercepted and altered. The evidence—a locked drawer brimming with cheques and a ledger in a spidery hand—pointed to Miss Lavington, the unofficial postmistress and daughter of the late Dr. Lavington. Yet, as Hesslewick knew, the obvious answer was rarely the right one.

He began with Mrs. Ada Phipps, retired schoolmistress and the first to notice her pension had shrunk. She sat ramrod straight, hands folded, eyes sharp behind her spectacles. “I trust Edith, of course,” she said, “but the handwriting on my cheque was quite unfamiliar. And she’s been at the post office at all hours—odd, don’t you think?”

Mr. Harold Tewkesbury, widower and another victim, shuffled in next. He relied on Miss Lavington for his correspondence, claiming his eyesight was not what it was. “Edith’s always been a help,” he mumbled, “but last week, she seemed distracted. Said she’d misplaced her ledger, though I saw it on her desk that morning.”

Miss Violet Craddock, the grocer’s wife, arrived with a flurry of apologies and a basket of bruised pears. “I do pop in now and then,” she admitted, “just to check on Edith. She’s been so busy lately, what with all the post and her lists. I did notice her drawer was locked, which is new. And she’s been terribly particular about her tea, won’t let anyone else make it.”

PC Griggs, the village constable, contributed little beyond confusion. “Heard something about a bank in Brighton,” he said, scratching his ear. “But I thought Edith’s cousin managed her accounts. Or was it her aunt? Hard to say, with all these names.”

Hesslewick moved through the cottage, noting the dustless keyhole on the drawer, the faint indentation where a heavy ledger had once rested, and the teacup with a lipstick smudge, though Miss Lavington wore none. He asked about the bank account in Brighton. Miss Lavington insisted she’d never been, though Mrs. Phipps recalled seeing her with a suitcase on the early bus, just once, and she said it was for a funeral.

As the afternoon waned, Hesslewick gathered the villagers in the parlour. He recited the facts: the altered cheques, the hidden ledger, the Brighton account. He watched faces, listened for the slip, the hesitation. Miss Lavington’s composure never wavered, but Violet Craddock’s eyes darted to the locked drawer, then away.

“Curious,” Hesslewick murmured, “how a ledger can be misplaced in a house so orderly. And how a drawer can be locked, yet the key is always in plain sight.”

He paused, letting the silence settle. “One wonders who else might have had reason to visit at odd hours or to know where the ledger was kept.”

He closed his notebook with a snap. “There is, I think, one detail that does not fit. One person who knows more than they should.”

Who is it, and what have they revealed?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The guilty party is Miss Violet Craddock. The telling clue is her knowledge of the locked drawer. In her conversation, Violet remarks that the drawer was locked, which she claims is a new habit of Edith’s. However, the only way Violet could know the drawer was locked is if she had tried to open it herself—something she had no reason to do as a casual visitor and friend. Furthermore, she mentions Edith’s particularity about her tea, implying she’s been present during private moments, but Edith is known for her obsession with order and privacy. 

Violet’s curiosity and frequent visits gave her opportunity. She likely intercepted the cheques when helping Edith with errands or during her visits, and, knowing where the ledger was kept, altered the records. The lipstick on the teacup is another subtle hint: Edith does not wear lipstick, but Violet does, suggesting she made herself at home in Edith’s absence. The drawer’s key being in plain sight means anyone could have accessed it, but only someone who tried would know it was locked. 

Red herrings include Mrs. Phipps’s memory of Edith’s odd hours (which could be explained by her postmistress duties) and Mr. Tewkesbury’s confusion about the ledger’s location (likely a simple lapse). PC Griggs’s muddled statements add to the confusion but do not point to the truth. 

Hesslewick deduces Violet’s guilt from her behavioral slip: her knowledge of the locked drawer, which she should not possess unless she was involved in the fraud.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 English village setting. The characters are distinct and their roles in the community are clear, with dialogue and observations that feel authentic to the period. The puzzle is presented with subtlety, and the clues are embedded naturally in the suspects’ statements and Hesslewick’s observations. The detective’s notes are structured, immersive, and avoid giving away the solution, maintaining the integrity of the puzzle.

The narrative is tight and avoids unnecessary exposition. The open-ended question at the end invites the reader to deduce the culprit without leading them. The suspects are presented neutrally, with no editorial bias or overt clues in their descriptions.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue—Violet’s knowledge of the locked drawer—relies on careful reading and inference, rather than physical evidence or trivial details. The lipstick on the teacup is a secondary, subtle clue. The red herrings are plausible and do not distract from the main thread. The reasoning is sound and fits the investigative style of Inspector Hesslewick.

The puzzle is not trivial, as it requires attention to dialogue and behavioral slips rather than overt evidence. However, it is not overly difficult, as the clues are present and fair.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

Overall, the puzzle is well-constructed, immersive, and fair, with a solution that rewards attentive reading and logical deduction.
