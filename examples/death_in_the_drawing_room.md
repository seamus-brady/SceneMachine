## Narrative

The drawing room of Lavington House, with its threadbare Persian rug and faint scent of mothballs, had seen livelier evenings. On this October night, the supper party was subdued: Mrs. Edith Lavington presided from her armchair, a porcelain teacup at her elbow, while her husband, Harold, leafed through the Times with the air of a man reading his own obituary. The others—Miss Clara Denby, Alice Finch, and George Tilley—kept to the edges, each wishing the evening over for their own reasons.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived just after the commotion began. Mrs. Lavington had taken her tea, coughed once, and slumped sideways, her expression frozen between irritation and surprise. The village doctor could only confirm what was already suspected: arsenic poisoning.

Hesslewick moved through the room with the certainty of a man who has seen too many bodies and too few honest faces. He noted that Mrs. Lavington’s tea had been prepared separately, as always, for her delicate digestion. Alice Finch, the kitchen maid, had made the tea under Mrs. Lavington’s watchful eye. George Tilley, the gardener, was the only other person with a key to the shed where arsenic was kept, used for the roses and, occasionally, for less legal purposes. Miss Denby, the companion, hovered nearby, her hands twisting a handkerchief. Mr. Lavington, pale and distracted, insisted he had been in the study with estate accounts.

Hesslewick began his inquiries. Alice Finch, eyes wide and knuckles white, insisted she had done nothing different—she fetched the water, boiled it, and poured it over the leaves in Mrs. Lavington’s favourite cup. She had not left the kitchen except to bring in the tea. Miss Denby admitted she had stepped out to the terrace for air just before the tea was served. George Tilley claimed to have been in the potting shed, repairing a spade, and had not entered the house until summoned. Mr. Lavington seemed more concerned with the family finances than his wife’s death.

Hesslewick examined the kitchen. The tin of tea leaves was untouched, the kettle still warm. The cup, however, bore a faint, bitter tang—arsenic. He asked Alice about the key to the gardener’s shed. She shook her head: only Mrs. Lavington and George Tilley had keys, and the shed had been locked when she fetched coal for the kitchen fire earlier that afternoon.

Miss Denby, when asked about her time on the terrace, mentioned seeing George Tilley crossing the lawn, though she could not say where he was headed. Tilley insisted he had not left the shed. Mr. Lavington, when asked about the keys, seemed surprised to learn his wife kept one on a chain around her neck—he had assumed George was the only one trusted with such things.

As the evening wore on, Hesslewick sat in the drawing room, notebook open, watching the interplay of glances and silences. The fire crackled, the clock ticked, and somewhere in the house, a door creaked. He asked whether anyone had seen Mrs. Lavington with her key that evening. Miss Denby hesitated, then said she had noticed the chain was missing from Mrs. Lavington’s neck when she came down for supper.

Hesslewick closed his notebook. The solution, he suspected, lay not in who had access to the arsenic, but in who understood the routines of the house—and who had reason to disrupt them.

Who poisoned Mrs. Lavington, and how did they manage it?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The murderer is Miss Clara Denby. The key clue is the missing key: Mrs. Lavington always wore her shed key on a chain around her neck, but on the evening of the murder, the chain was missing. Miss Denby, as her companion, would have had ample opportunity to notice this—and, crucially, to take it. She claimed to have gone to the terrace for air just before the tea was served, but this would have given her a chance to slip out, use the stolen key to access the shed, and obtain the arsenic. She then returned, unnoticed, and could have easily slipped the poison into Mrs. Lavington’s cup while Alice was distracted in the kitchen (perhaps fetching the coal, as mentioned). The red herrings include George Tilley’s supposed access (he never left the shed), Alice’s nervousness (she was simply frightened of being blamed), and Mr. Lavington’s financial woes (he had no access to the arsenic). The telling detail is Miss Denby’s knowledge of the missing key—something only the guilty party would have noticed and used to their advantage.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric, consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, and tightly written. The suspects are clearly delineated by role and personality, and the puzzle preserves ambiguity without telegraphing the solution. The detective’s notes are immersive, summarising the key facts and suspects without revealing or hinting at the solution. The narrative avoids modern anachronisms and maintains a period-appropriate tone. The solution is logical and deducible: the missing key, Miss Denby’s opportunity, and her knowledge of the key’s absence all point to her guilt, but only if the reader pieces together the timeline and access. The red herrings are plausible and not overplayed. The puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring attention to routine, motive, and opportunity, but not so obscure as to be unfair. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle for the reader. Overall, this is a well-constructed cosy crime puzzle with a difficulty level of 6 out of 10.
