## Narrative

Scene One: The Cottage on Church Lane

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at Mrs. Lavington’s ivy-clad cottage as the sun set behind the orchard. The kitchen, still fragrant with bitter almonds, was a tableau of rural order: blue willow china, a half-eaten supper, and the late Mrs. Edith Lavington slumped at her place, lips tinged faintly blue. Mabel Hurst, the housemaid, hovered in the doorway, wringing her hands. PC Griggs stood by the garden gate, looking as if he’d rather be anywhere else.

Hesslewick moved through the kitchen with silent precision. He noted the teapot, the untouched bread, the single cup. The window above the sink was open, letting in the cool Sussex air. On the table, a letter lay folded beside Mrs. Lavington’s spectacles.

Scene Two: The Cast Assembles

Arthur Lavington, the estranged nephew, arrived soon after, his city suit incongruous against the cottage’s worn flagstones. He offered condolences with the air of a man rehearsing for an audience. Nurse Agnes Bell, brisk and practical, had already pronounced the cause: cyanide, her nose wrinkling at the scent. Percy Wren, the postman, lingered by the gate, recounting his morning’s delivery with unnecessary detail. Mabel, still pale, recounted how she’d found her mistress at half past six, supper untouched but for a single bite of apple tart.

Scene Three: The Interviews

Hesslewick began with Mabel. She’d been polishing the silver and heard nothing unusual. No visitors, no strange noises. She’d brought in the tart at six, then left Mrs. Lavington to her meal. Arthur claimed to have arrived from London that afternoon, stopping by the cottage at four to discuss the will. He left, he said, before tea. Percy Wren insisted he’d seen Mrs. Lavington alive at five, exchanging pleasantries at the gate. Nurse Bell, summoned by Mabel, arrived just after the discovery and briskly took charge.

Scene Four: The Details

Hesslewick examined the kitchen. The apple tart, half-eaten, was removed for analysis. The teapot, still warm, contained only Mrs. Lavington’s preferred blend. No sign of forced entry, no footprints in the garden. The amended will, signed and witnessed, lay in the study. The village, of course, was already abuzz: Arthur’s return, the new will, Mrs. Lavington’s good spirits that morning.

Scene Five: The Contradictions

Arthur, pressed gently, insisted he’d left before tea and had not seen Mrs. Lavington since. Yet Percy Wren, the postman, described seeing Arthur’s coat hanging in the hall at five, long after Arthur claimed to have departed. Mabel, asked about the tart, said she’d prepared it herself and left it cooling on the sideboard. Nurse Bell, when asked about poisons, remarked that cyanide was rare in the village, but the old orchard shed still held remnants from the days of pest control.

Scene Six: The Puzzle

As dusk deepened, Hesslewick stood in the kitchen, notebook in hand. The village nurse, the loyal maid, the returning nephew, the ever-present postman—each with a story, each with a motive or opportunity. The scent of bitter almonds lingered, stubborn as memory.

Why does Hesslewick pause at the mention of the orchard shed? What detail in the timeline troubles him? What has he realized about the fatal supper?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the timeline and the knowledge revealed by the suspects. Arthur Lavington claimed to have left the cottage at four, yet Percy Wren saw his coat in the hall at five, suggesting Arthur was still present. However, the real clue is subtler: Nurse Bell, when discussing cyanide, mentioned the orchard shed and its old pest control chemicals. Yet, she claimed to have arrived only after being summoned by Mabel, after the body was found. There was no reason for her to know about the shed’s contents unless she had been there earlier.

Furthermore, the apple tart was prepared by Mabel and left cooling, but only Mrs. Lavington ate it. The poison was likely administered in the tart, not the tea. Nurse Bell’s familiarity with cyanide and the orchard shed, combined with her early arrival and brisk assumption of control, point to her as the culprit. She had access to the shed, knowledge of poisons, and a plausible reason to visit the cottage under the guise of checking on Mrs. Lavington’s health. Her slip—referencing the shed’s contents before anyone mentioned them—betrayed her involvement. Hesslewick deduced that Nurse Bell poisoned the tart during an earlier, unaccounted-for visit, relying on her trusted status and medical authority to deflect suspicion.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, well-paced, and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The details—such as the blue willow china, the orchard, and the village social dynamics—are evocative and immersive. The introduction of suspects and their roles is clear and neutral, and the interviews unfold naturally. The inclusion of the detective’s notes deepens immersion and maintains the puzzle’s integrity without tipping the reader.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains a tight focus on the investigation. The suspects’ personalities and community roles are distinct, and the clues are embedded subtly in dialogue and observation. The open-ended questions at the end are well-phrased and do not lead the reader toward the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The critical clue is Nurse Bell’s premature knowledge of the orchard shed’s contents, which is not something she should know unless she had visited earlier. The timeline inconsistencies with Arthur are a red herring, adding complexity without being misleading. The method of poisoning is plausible for the period and setting. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a classic cosy crime puzzle.

Inconsistencies or Errors:

- The narrative is coherent and consistent with the time period.
- The only minor issue is that the solution hinges on a single slip of knowledge from Nurse Bell; a secondary, corroborating clue (such as a witness seeing her near the shed) could strengthen the deduction.
- All suspects have plausible motives and opportunities, and the puzzle is solvable from the information given.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring careful attention to dialogue and timeline details. The solution is satisfying and fair, with a subtle but accessible clue at its heart.
