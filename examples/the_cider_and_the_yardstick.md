## Narrative

It was the sort of October evening that made the Hare & Hounds’ public bar feel less like a room and more like a lifeboat. Wind rattled the windowpanes, and the regulars huddled close to the fire, their voices rising and falling with the gusts. At the battered oak table beneath the dartboard, the weekly card game was in full swing: Ernest Tilley, red-faced and restless; Walter Hodge, his moustache bristling with each lost shilling; Lionel Prowse, the landlord’s son, watching the coins with a proprietary air; and, for a brief spell, Mabel Tilley, who hovered at the edge of the game like a storm cloud.

Mrs. Griggs, the landlady, moved between bar and kitchen with her usual briskness, dispensing cider, gossip, and the occasional warning glance. The game was interrupted twice: once when Mrs. Griggs fetched a fresh jug from the taproom, and again when Lionel was called away to help his father with a stubborn barrel. Mabel slipped out to the yard, returning with cheeks flushed and eyes sharper than before.

At half past eight, Ernest Tilley slumped forward, scattering coins and cards. His tankard of cider—half-drained—tipped, sending a thin stream across the table. Mrs. Griggs fetched water and, at Walter’s urging, a splash of brandy. Dr. Fenwick, summoned from his supper, pronounced it poisoning. Arsenic, he said, with the certainty of a man who’d seen too much of it in the war.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived before the body was removed, his presence as chilly as the draught from the door. He listened, observed, and asked questions in a voice that never quite rose above a murmur.

Lionel Prowse, pale and defensive, insisted he’d been in the cellar with his father when the cider was poured. Mrs. Griggs, bustling but watchful, claimed she’d poured all the drinks herself, save for a single glass fetched by Lionel earlier in the evening. Walter Hodge, still nursing his losses, muttered about Tilley’s sharp play but swore he’d never stoop to murder. Mabel, arms folded, said little—her gaze fixed on the tankard as if it might yield up her secrets.

Hesslewick paced the bar, notebook in hand. He noted the comings and goings, the untouched cider at Walter’s elbow, the faint trace of white powder on the rim of Tilley’s tankard. He asked Mrs. Griggs about the cleaning cupboard, and Lionel about the key to the storeroom. He watched Mabel’s hands, steady as she recounted her time in the yard.

The evening wore on. Alibis were offered, then quietly contradicted. Walter insisted he’d never left the table, but a barmaid recalled him slipping out to the yard for a smoke. Mrs. Griggs remembered fetching water, but not who handed Tilley his last drink. Lionel grew agitated when pressed about the debt Tilley had repaid. Mabel, asked about her absence, shrugged: ‘I needed air. Ernest knew how to fill a room.’

As the fire burned low, Hesslewick gathered the players. He recited the timeline, the movements, the drinks poured and hands played. Then he closed his notebook and looked, not at the suspects, but at the tankard—half-drained, rim dusted with poison, and set precisely where Tilley’s right hand would fall.

He asked one final question, and waited.

What detail in the evening’s events led Inspector Hesslewick to his conclusion?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the sequence of who handled the drinks and the physical impossibility in the suspects’ stories. Mrs. Griggs claimed to have poured all the drinks herself, except for a single glass fetched by Lionel. However, the tankard that poisoned Tilley was not freshly poured—it was already at his place when the game resumed after Lionel’s absence. Lionel claimed to have been in the cellar with his father, but the only time the tankard could have been tampered with was during the brief interval when Lionel fetched a glass for another player. The faint trace of white powder on the rim, rather than in the cider itself, suggests the poison was applied after the drink was poured, likely while Tilley was distracted by the game.

The telling clue: Lionel’s knowledge of the tankard’s position. When pressed, he described where Tilley’s drink was set—something he could not have known unless he’d handled it himself. This knowledge, combined with the opportunity when he fetched a glass and the motive of recent financial resentment, points to Lionel as the murderer. The red herrings—Walter’s argument, Mabel’s absence, Mrs. Griggs’s bustling—distract, but only Lionel’s story contains the fatal slip: knowledge he should not have had.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and evocative, capturing the rural English pub setting of 1937 with strong period detail and characterisation. The pacing is tight, with each interruption and movement serving a purpose in the unfolding mystery. The suspects are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the interplay between them is believable and engaging. The inclusion of Inspector Hesslewick’s investigative style is consistent with the established character and setting.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that preserves immersion and provides a structured summary without revealing or hinting at the solution. The suspect list is neutral and avoids editorialising, focusing on roles and observable traits.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains coherence throughout. The dialogue and actions are consistent with the 1930s rural English setting. The open-ended question at the end invites the reader to consider the evidence without leading them to the answer.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue—Lionel’s knowledge of the tankard’s position—relies on attentive reading and careful consideration of the suspects’ statements and movements. The application of poison to the rim, rather than the cider, is a subtle but fair clue. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

There are no significant inconsistencies or errors. The only minor point is that the narrative could clarify the timeline of Lionel’s absence and the handling of the drinks a little more, but this does not undermine the solvability or fairness of the puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle requires careful attention to detail and inference, making it moderately challenging but fair for experienced readers of the genre.
