## Narrative

Evening settled over Thornley Garth with a persistent drizzle that made even the lychgate at St. Swithin’s Church seem to huddle in on itself. Mrs. Edith Larkham, wrapped in a faded shawl, stood by the ancient gate, her gloved hands trembling as she placed a battered biscuit tin behind the mossy stone pillar. She glanced about; no one was visible, though the windows of the cottages along Church Lane glimmered with lamplight.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned by a note from Mrs. Larkham, arrived as dusk threatened to swallow the churchyard. He found her pacing, eyes darting between the gate and the vicarage. She pressed the blackmail letters into his hand, her voice barely above a whisper. “They know something about Arthur. Something that could ruin me. The last note said to leave the money here, before dusk.”

Hesslewick examined the letters: formal, clipped handwriting, no postmark. Delivered by hand. He noted the tin’s position: visible from the lane, but shielded from the church porch.

He began his circuit. Mr. Harold Tilling, the retired schoolmaster, emerged from his cottage, pipe in hand. “I saw Edith out here,” he said, “but no one else. I was reading by the window, as I do most evenings.”

Miss Ivy Prowse, the postmistress, bustled up the lane, arms full of unsorted mail. “I’ve not seen a soul near the lychgate,” she said, “but I did spot Sidney Rudge loitering by the vestry earlier. He’s been in low spirits—money troubles, I hear.”

Sidney Rudge, the verger, was found in the churchyard, trimming the yew hedge with more energy than precision. “I was here all afternoon,” he said, “preparing for the Sunday service. Didn’t see Mrs. Larkham, nor anyone else. I keep to myself.”

Mrs. Clara Finch, a friend of Mrs. Larkham, arrived breathless. “I was visiting my cousin on Orchard Row. Only just returned. Such a fuss over nothing, Edith. Who would dare blackmail you?”

Hesslewick walked the lane, noting muddy footprints leading from the lychgate toward the vicarage, but the drizzle had blurred them beyond recognition. He paused at the post office: the door was locked, but a faint scent of lavender lingered in the air—a detail he filed away.

He returned to the lychgate as the church bell tolled seven. The biscuit tin was gone. No one claimed to have seen a thing.

Later, over weak tea in Mrs. Larkham’s parlour, Hesslewick listened as each villager repeated their alibi. Tilling, always precise, recounted the chapters he’d read. Ivy Prowse insisted she was sorting mail, though the post office had closed early for the day. Sidney Rudge, hands still stained with yew sap, swore he never left the churchyard. Clara Finch, ever the gossip, seemed more interested in speculating about the contents of the letters than in offering her own whereabouts.

Hesslewick’s gaze lingered on Ivy Prowse. “You say you were sorting mail, Miss Prowse. Yet the post office was locked at six, and you were seen on the lane at half past. Odd, isn’t it?”

She flushed, but said nothing.

The drizzle thickened, and the village settled into uneasy silence. Hesslewick closed his notebook, his mind ticking over the contradictions. Someone had known precisely when Mrs. Larkham would leave the tin. Someone who could move unseen, whose knowledge of the village’s routines was nearly perfect.

Who collected the tin? And what detail in the suspects’ stories does not fit?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key contradiction lies in Miss Ivy Prowse’s alibi. She claims to have been sorting mail at the post office, but the post office was locked at six, and she was seen on the lane at half past six with unsorted mail in her arms. This is inconsistent: if she had truly been inside sorting mail, she would not have been seen outside with the mail after closing time. Furthermore, as postmistress, she would know the precise routines of the villagers, including Mrs. Larkham’s habits and the visibility of the lychgate from the cottages. The faint scent of lavender in the post office—distinctive to Ivy—suggests she had recently been there, but her presence on the lane at the crucial time is unexplained. The formal, clipped handwriting matches her professional style. The red herrings—Sidney’s money troubles, Tilling’s proximity, Clara’s gossip—do not account for the precise timing and knowledge required. Hesslewick deduces that Ivy Prowse delivered the letters and collected the tin, using her position and routine to avoid suspicion. Her motive likely stems from the old inheritance dispute and a desire for quiet revenge or financial gain. The contradiction in her alibi, combined with her access and opportunity, reveals her as the blackmailer.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The language and details are consistent with the period, and the characters are distinct, each with plausible motives or distractions. The inclusion of Inspector Hesslewick’s investigative style is reflected in the careful, observational tone and the subtle psychological pressure applied during interviews. The narrative is tight, with no extraneous detail, and the pacing maintains suspense without rushing the reader.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that deepens immersion, summarising the incident, suspects, and known facts without revealing clues or bias. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and personalities rather than hinting at guilt.

The open-ended questions at the end of the narrative preserve the puzzle, inviting the reader to consider inconsistencies without steering them toward the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Ivy Prowse’s alibi is clearly presented in the story, and her access, opportunity, and knowledge are all established. The red herrings are plausible but not misleading. The motive, while only briefly referenced, is credible within the context of village life and past disputes. The solution avoids triviality and is neither too obvious nor too obscure.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to alibis and routines, making it moderately challenging for readers who enjoy classic deduction. The clues are fair, and the narrative does not rely on obscure knowledge or leaps of logic. The difficulty is appropriate for a cosy crime puzzle, offering satisfaction to those who solve it without frustration for those who do not.
