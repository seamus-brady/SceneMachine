## Narrative

It was the sort of night that made even the hedgerows seem to lean in, listening. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at St. Cuthbert’s churchyard just after dawn, his boots sinking into the dew-heavy grass. The grave of Miss Edith Lavington, disturbed in the small hours, lay open like an accusation. A spade, still wet with earth, rested against the lichen-stained wall. Boot prints—size nine, men’s—led away toward the vicarage, but the coffin, though prised open, seemed untouched. Nothing appeared stolen. Yet the village buzzed with talk of a sealed envelope, rumoured to have been buried with Edith, its contents the subject of much speculation and more than a little envy.

Hesslewick found the Reverend Arthur Pym standing stiffly by the vestry door, his cassock immaculate despite the hour. Pym’s voice was clipped. “A desecration, Inspector. Edith and I disagreed, yes, but this—this is sacrilege.”

Mrs. Clara Finch, the herbalist, hovered nearby, her hands stained with nettle and her eyes red-rimmed. “Edith was a friend. I came to leave flowers last night, as I often do. I saw nothing amiss.”

PC Lionel Griggs, the village constable, had already cordoned off the grave with a length of twine. He shuffled, uncomfortable. “I was on patrol. Heard a noise, but by the time I arrived, whoever it was had gone. My torch caught those prints, but they vanish at the vicarage gate.”

Miss Ivy Lavington, Edith’s niece, stood apart, her London coat incongruous among the Sussex mud. “I was at the inn all night, Inspector. I’ve no interest in village superstitions. My aunt’s affairs are my only concern.”

Hesslewick began his methodical circuit. The spade was old, the handle worn smooth. The boot prints were deep, but the stride was uneven—perhaps a limp? He noted a faint scent of lavender near the grave, out of place in the cold morning air.

He spoke first with Mrs. Finch, who insisted she left before midnight. “I saw the vicar’s study light on as I passed. He keeps odd hours, you know.”

Reverend Pym claimed he was writing sermons until two, never leaving his study. “I heard nothing. My window faces the churchyard, but the curtains were drawn.”

PC Griggs, when pressed, admitted he’d checked the vicarage after seeing the prints, but found nothing. “I did notice the vestry door was ajar, though. Odd, that.”

Miss Ivy, cool and precise, produced her inn receipt, time-stamped 11:45 p.m. “I retired early. I can’t imagine why anyone would disturb Aunt Edith’s rest.”

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick observed Mrs. Finch brushing soil from her skirt, though she claimed not to have approached the grave. He noted the vicar’s boots, polished and clean, size eight. Griggs’s boots, size ten, caked with mud. Ivy’s shoes, city-made, unsuited to the churchyard’s churned earth.

By noon, the village had gathered in uneasy knots, speculation thick as mist. Hesslewick, notebook in hand, reviewed his observations. The envelope, if it existed, was still unaccounted for. No one admitted knowledge of its contents, though Mrs. Finch’s eyes lingered on the grave longer than most.

Hesslewick called the group together beneath the yew tree. “Someone here knows more than they admit. The answer lies not in what was taken, but in what was left behind.”

He paused, letting the silence settle. “What detail betrays the truth of last night’s events?”

What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the boot prints and the spade. The prints are size nine, men’s, and lead toward the vicarage, but neither Reverend Pym (size eight) nor PC Griggs (size ten) wears that size. Miss Ivy’s shoes are city-made and too small. Only Mrs. Finch remains, but she is a woman and would not be expected to wear men’s boots. However, Hesslewick noticed Mrs. Finch brushing soil from her skirt and the scent of lavender—her trademark—near the grave. The uneven stride in the prints suggests someone unused to the boots. Mrs. Finch borrowed or stole a pair of men’s boots (possibly from the church or a neighbor) to disguise her tracks, hoping suspicion would fall on a man. She exhumed the coffin to retrieve the envelope, but finding it gone or never there, she left in haste, discarding the spade. The vestry door ajar supports her access to the church’s stores. The real clue is the mismatch between the boot size and the available suspects, combined with Mrs. Finch’s behavior and the environmental detail of lavender. Hesslewick deduces that Mrs. Finch, motivated by her knowledge of Edith’s secrets, staged the scene to mislead, but her attempt to mask her involvement was betrayed by her own habits and a detail only she would leave behind.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong period detail and a cast of plausible suspects. The puzzle is fair: all clues necessary to deduce the solution are present, but not overtly highlighted. The detective’s notes are consistent with Hesslewick’s investigative style and deepen immersion without spoiling the puzzle.

The solution is logical and satisfying. The deduction hinges on the mismatch between the boot prints and the suspects’ footwear, the behavioral detail of Mrs. Finch brushing soil from her skirt, and the scent of lavender. The narrative avoids leading the reader directly to the answer, instead presenting a web of plausible alibis and motives. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle element.

Minor tightening could be done to remove a few redundant phrases, but overall, the narrative is coherent and consistent with the time period. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty: 7/10. The puzzle requires attentive reading and careful consideration of character behavior and environmental clues, but is solvable with the information provided.
