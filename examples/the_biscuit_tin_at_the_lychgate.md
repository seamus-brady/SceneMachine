## Narrative

Orchard House, with its tangled roses and air of genteel decay, had seen better days, but Mrs. Edith Lavington kept up appearances. The scandal—Brighton, before the war—was a ghost she’d long since locked away. Yet the letters came, each more insistent, each delivered to the back door with uncanny stealth. Fifty pounds, demanded the last, to be left in a battered Huntley & Palmers tin behind the lychgate at St. Agnes’ Church. Silence, or ruin.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived on a Tuesday, summoned by a note from PC Griggs, who had found the latest letter wedged beneath a milk bottle. Hesslewick’s entrance was quiet, his gaze sharper than the village’s frost. He found Mrs. Lavington pale but composed, Miss Clara Finch hovering with tea and anxious glances, Vera Lavington sprawled in a window seat with a cigarette, and Mr. Lionel Pargeter, the solicitor, already present on the pretext of reviewing Edith’s will. Reverend Blythe arrived soon after, apologizing for the mud on his shoes—he’d been tending the churchyard, he said, though the day was dry.

The detective began with the letters. The handwriting was disguised, but the paper was from Edith’s own writing desk. The biscuit tin, retrieved from behind the lychgate, was empty save for a scrap of newspaper. No one admitted to seeing anything unusual, though Vera claimed she’d glimpsed a figure near the church at dusk. Clara, flustered, insisted she’d been in the kitchen all evening. Pargeter, with a lawyer’s precision, recounted his whereabouts: at his office, then a brief stop at the pub, then home. Reverend Blythe, ever the shepherd, said he’d been locking up the vestry.

Hesslewick walked the route from Orchard House to the church, noting the muddy verge and the dry path beneath the yew trees. He asked about debts, inheritances, and Brighton, receiving more evasion than answers. He observed Clara’s hands, ink-stained; Vera’s impatience; Pargeter’s nervous tapping; Blythe’s careful avoidance of eye contact.

Later, over tepid tea, Hesslewick listened as Vera and Clara bickered about the tin—Clara insisted it had been missing from the pantry for days, Vera swore she’d seen it on the kitchen shelf that morning. Pargeter, asked about the estate, mentioned offhand that Edith’s will was locked in his safe, but that he’d brought a copy for Edith to review. Blythe, pressed about his late-night walks, muttered something about insomnia and parish worries.

As dusk fell, Hesslewick returned to the church. The lychgate’s hinges squeaked, but the ground beneath was undisturbed—no footprints, no scuff marks. He lingered, watching the windows of Orchard House flicker to life. The village, for all its gossip, kept its secrets well.

The next morning, Hesslewick gathered them all in the drawing room. He recited the facts: the letters, the tin, the lychgate, the Brighton scandal. He watched faces, not words. Then he asked, almost idly, why the tin had been chosen as the drop. Clara blushed, Vera scoffed, Pargeter looked blank, and Blythe adjusted his collar.

Hesslewick closed his notebook. "Curious, isn’t it, how a detail out of place can unravel a whole design?" he said. "One thing, in particular, doesn’t fit."

What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key clue is the biscuit tin. Clara Finch claimed it had been missing from the pantry for days, yet Vera Lavington insisted she saw it on the kitchen shelf that very morning. However, when Hesslewick inspected the tin at the lychgate, it was not only empty but also clean—no crumbs, no dust, no sign of recent use. If the tin had truly been missing for days, it would have shown signs of neglect or at least some dust from the pantry. Instead, it had clearly been handled and cleaned recently.

Furthermore, the ground beneath the lychgate was undisturbed—no footprints, no scuff marks—suggesting the tin had not been placed there by anyone coming from Orchard House that night. The only person with plausible access to both the church and the house, and a reason to avoid being seen, was Reverend Blythe. His claim of locking up the vestry was contradicted by the dry weather and his muddy shoes, and his late-night presence near the lychgate was explained away too conveniently.

The clincher: the newspaper scrap inside the tin was from the parish newsletter, which only Blythe would have ready access to. Blythe, protective of his parish’s reputation and privy to Edith’s past through confession or gossip, orchestrated the blackmail to prevent a scandal that might damage the church. His behavioral slip—muddy shoes on a dry day—betrayed his nocturnal visit to Orchard House’s back garden, where the soil remained damp from watering.

Thus, Hesslewick deduced that Reverend Blythe was the blackmailer, his motive a twisted sense of guardianship over both Edith and the church’s good name.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong period detail and a cast of plausible, well-drawn characters. The prose is tight and evocative, with each suspect given a distinct personality and role within the community. The clues are woven into the narrative without being heavy-handed, and the dialogue and observations are consistent with the time period and Hesslewick’s investigative style. The story maintains a sense of ambiguity and tension, inviting the reader to puzzle out the solution without overtly leading them.

The detective’s notes are structured, neutral, and immersive, summarizing the key facts and suspects without tipping the reader toward the solution. The questions at the end are open-ended and encourage further thought.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and deducible from the narrative. The clean state of the tin, the undisturbed ground at the lychgate, the parish newsletter scrap, and Blythe’s muddy shoes on a dry day all point toward the vicar as the blackmailer. The motive is plausible and fits the character’s role and access. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful reading and inference, particularly regarding the physical clues and the suspects’ movements.

Potential Issues:

- The timeline regarding the tin’s disappearance could be slightly clearer, but the contradiction between Clara and Vera’s accounts is sufficient for the puzzle.
- The motive, while plausible, is somewhat subtle; some readers may wish for a slightly stronger hint at Blythe’s internal reasoning, though this preserves the puzzle’s challenge.

Difficulty Rating: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring attention to detail and inference from subtle clues. It is fair and satisfying for readers who enjoy classic village mysteries.

Final Review:

The narrative and solution are coherent, immersive, and consistent with the setting and period. The puzzle is fair, logical, and satisfying, with a difficulty level that will engage most readers without being either too easy or obscure.
