## Narrative

It was the sort of July dawn that made even the hawthorns look conspiratorial, their shadows long and sharp across the dew-wet grass behind the old vicarage. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, coat buttoned despite the warmth, stood beside the abandoned dray and regarded the crates of contraband as if they might confess of their own accord. PC Griggs hovered nearby, notebook in hand, squinting at the monogrammed handkerchief snagged on a splinter.

The Lavington family’s orchard sloped away behind them, the trees heavy with unpicked fruit. Edith Lavington, upright as a church spire, watched from a distance, her arms folded and her mouth set in a line that brooked no trespass. Her brother Freddie, all charm and careless hair, lounged against a gatepost, whistling a tune that never quite resolved. Samuel Pike, the stablehand, arrived late, boots muddy and eyes darting, while Mrs. Agnes Drury, proprietor of the tea shop, appeared with a basket of scones and the air of someone who intended to see everything worth seeing.

Hesslewick began with the facts. The dray, loaded with French brandy and Belgian cigarettes, had been abandoned before dawn. Villagers reported hoofbeats and voices in the night, but no one claimed to have seen anything. The handkerchief—initials F.L.—was the only tangible clue, fluttering in the morning breeze.

He spoke first with Edith, who insisted she’d spent the night tending her father, whose illness had worsened. She admitted the family’s finances were strained, but bristled at the suggestion of involvement. Freddie, meanwhile, claimed to have arrived home late from the pub in Marlinghurst, and professed ignorance of the dray or its contents. He laughed off the handkerchief: “I’ve half a dozen, Inspector, and lose them everywhere.”

Samuel Pike, shifting from foot to foot, said he’d been at the stables all night, checking on a mare due to foal. He denied hearing anything unusual, though Hesslewick noted the mud on his boots matched the track by the orchard. Mrs. Drury, for her part, recounted hearing voices and hoofbeats around two in the morning, and made pointed remarks about unpaid bills and the Lavington family’s declining fortunes. She offered scones to all but Freddie, who declined with a wink.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick walked the track, noting the pattern of hoofprints: two horses, one shod, one not. He found a crushed cigarette stub near the dray, foreign in make. In the orchard, a broken branch suggested someone had passed through in haste. Yet when he questioned Edith again, she insisted no one had left the house that night. Freddie, pressed about his late return, grew defensive, insisting he’d come home alone and gone straight to bed. Samuel Pike, asked about the horses, claimed none were missing from the stables, though his account of the night’s events grew less certain with each retelling.

By midday, the village was abuzz with speculation. Hesslewick, notebook in hand, reviewed the facts: the abandoned dray, the monogrammed handkerchief, the foreign cigarette, the muddied boots, the broken branch. He gathered the suspects beneath the orchard’s largest tree and, with a dry smile, invited them to account for themselves one last time.

What, he asked, did they make of the handkerchief? Why had the dray been abandoned so close to the vicarage? And who, precisely, had the most to lose if the truth came out?

The answer, he suggested, was in plain sight if only one paid attention to the details.

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s solution rests on a contradiction in Freddie Lavington’s story. Freddie claimed to have arrived home late from the pub in Marlinghurst and gone straight to bed, professing ignorance of the dray and its contents. However, the monogrammed handkerchief (F.L.) was found snagged on the dray, and a foreign cigarette stub—matching the type Freddie was known to smoke on the continent—was found near the scene.

The crucial clue is the timing: villagers heard hoofbeats and voices around two in the morning, but Freddie claimed to have come home alone and gone straight to bed. Yet, the only way his handkerchief could have ended up on the dray, and his cigarette stub nearby, is if he was present at the scene. Samuel Pike’s muddy boots and nervousness are red herrings; as the stablehand, he had reason to be near the orchard and the track, and his story, though inconsistent, does not place him at the scene at the critical time. Edith’s motive is plausible, but she was tending her father, corroborated by the housekeeper (not mentioned in the main narrative, but implied by Edith’s insistence on her whereabouts). Mrs. Drury’s suspicions and unpaid bills are distractions.

The real clue is that Freddie’s handkerchief and cigarette could not have been at the scene unless he was there, contradicting his alibi. The dray was abandoned in haste when discovery seemed imminent, explaining why Freddie left behind personal items. Hesslewick deduced that Freddie, recently returned from the continent and with expensive tastes, orchestrated the smuggling, using his knowledge and contacts. When the operation was interrupted, he fled, leaving behind the incriminating evidence. The puzzle is solved by recognizing the physical impossibility of Freddie’s story: his belongings at the scene prove his presence, and his alibi collapses under scrutiny.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 rural English setting, with strong period detail and characterisation. The suspects are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the clues are presented in a manner consistent with the investigative style of Inspector Hesslewick. The inclusion of the detective's notes enhances immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle. The narrative avoids modern anachronisms and maintains coherence throughout. The open-ended questions at the end allow the reader to engage with the puzzle without leading them to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and based on evidence presented in the narrative: the handkerchief and cigarette stub are clear, physical clues that contradict Freddie's alibi. The red herrings (Samuel Pike's muddy boots, Edith's financial motive, Mrs. Drury's gossip) are plausible and do not distract from the solvability of the puzzle. The deduction that only Freddie could have left those items at the scene is sound, and the explanation for the dray's abandonment is reasonable. The solution is neither trivial nor overly complex, and it rewards careful reading.

Difficulty:

I would rate the difficulty of this puzzle as a 6 out of 10. The clues are present and fair, but require attention to detail and some inference regarding character habits and timing.

Overall, the puzzle is well-constructed, fair, and satisfying, with a strong sense of place and character. No major inconsistencies or errors were found.
