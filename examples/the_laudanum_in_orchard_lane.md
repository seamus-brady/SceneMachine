## Narrative

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at Miss Edith Lavington’s cottage on a morning that smelled of rain and secrets. The cottage, squat with roses climbing the lintel, sat at the end of Orchard Lane, its windows shuttered against the world. PC Griggs hovered by the gate, boots muddied, face pinched with the effort of appearing useful.

Inside, Miss Lavington lay pale but breathing, a bandage around her brow and a faint medicinal tang in the air. The bedroom was in disarray: a forced window latch, muddy footprints on the carpet, and a half-empty bottle of laudanum on the bedside table. Hesslewick’s gaze lingered on the footprints—large, certainly not a woman’s—and the window, which opened onto the sodden lawn.

Alice Carter, the housemaid, wrung her hands in the kitchen. “I found her just after seven, sir. She hadn’t rung for her tea. I thought it odd. The window was open, and she was—well, like that.”

“Anyone else in the house?” Hesslewick asked.

“No, sir. Only Miss Edith and me. Reverend Lavington comes for breakfast, but not till eight.”

Harold Pennington arrived soon after, his boots cleaner than the path allowed. “Dreadful business, Inspector. Edith could be difficult, but no one deserves this. My wife and I were at home all evening. We heard nothing.”

Mrs. Clara Pennington, trailing a scent of lavender and anxiety, added, “Edith threatened to ruin us all with her stories. But I’d never wish her harm. We were at the manor, reading. Harold never left my sight.”

Reverend Samuel Lavington, gaunt and grave, stood by the hearth. “My sister has always been forthright. She believed it her duty to expose sin, even if it meant pain. I was in the vicarage, preparing my sermon. I came as soon as Alice fetched me.”

Hesslewick walked the garden, noting the footprints leading away from the window, vanishing at the lane. He returned to the bedroom, studying the laudanum bottle. The label was smudged, but the cork sat neatly beside it. The teacup on the tray was untouched, though the pot was still warm.

He questioned Alice again. “Did Miss Lavington take laudanum regularly?”

“She kept it for her nerves, sir. But she never took it in the morning. Only at night, and only a drop.”

The Penningtons offered tea in the parlour. Clara’s hands shook as she poured. “Edith said she’d tell the whole village about Harold’s father. She was bluffing, surely. No one would listen.”

Harold’s jaw tightened. “My father’s mistakes are ancient history. Edith liked to stir trouble. But I was home all night. Ask Clara.”

Reverend Lavington, when pressed, admitted, “Edith and I quarreled yesterday. She accused me of cowardice. But I would never harm her. I was at the vicarage, alone.”

Hesslewick returned to the bedroom, notebook in hand. The footprints, the forced window, the laudanum—each detail sat uneasily. He stared at the teacup, then at the window. The rain had started again, softening the mud outside.

He gathered the household in the parlour. “Someone staged a break-in,” he said quietly. “But not as cleverly as they hoped.”

He looked at each face in turn, then at the window. “There is one thing that does not fit.”

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The puzzle hinges on the muddy footprints and the forced window. At first, it appears an intruder entered through the window, struck Miss Lavington, and escaped across the lawn. However, the footprints only lead away from the window, not toward it. If the attacker entered through the window, there should be muddy prints both entering and leaving. The fact that the prints only lead away suggests they were made after the attack, to stage the scene.

Harold Pennington’s boots are suspiciously clean, despite the muddy conditions outside. If he had walked across the lawn to stage the footprints, he would have had time to clean his boots before arriving. Clara claims Harold never left her sight, but her anxiety and the fact that she poured tea with shaking hands suggest she is hiding something. In reality, Clara slipped out during the evening, used Harold’s boots to make the prints, and forced the window from the inside to stage a break-in. She attempted to poison Edith with laudanum in her tea (which Edith did not drink), then struck her when the poison failed. Clara’s motive was to prevent Edith from exposing the family scandal and ruining their social standing. The environmental mismatch—the direction of the footprints—reveals the truth.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong period detail and a consistent tone. The cast of suspects is introduced naturally, and their motives are plausible within the social context. The clues are presented fairly, with the muddy footprints, the laudanum, and the forced window all serving as central elements. Dialogue is concise and in keeping with the era. The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains a sense of mystery throughout. The open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle for the reader.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that deepens immersion without spoiling the solution or tipping off the reader. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and personalities rather than editorial hints.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The direction of the footprints is a fair clue, and the detail about Harold’s clean boots is subtle but present. Clara’s motive is established through dialogue and her anxious behavior. The method—poisoning followed by a blow to the head—is plausible and fits the evidence. The solution is neither trivial nor overly complex, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty:

I would rate the difficulty as 6 out of 10. The puzzle requires careful attention to environmental clues and character behavior, but all necessary information is present in the narrative.

Overall, the puzzle is well-constructed, fair, and satisfying, with no major inconsistencies or errors.
