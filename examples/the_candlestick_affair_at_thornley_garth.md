## Narrative

Scene One: The Mist and the Lychgate

It was a June evening thick with mist, curling around the lychgate’s timbers. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, coat buttoned to the throat, stood just beyond the parish hall, where the village committee meeting had ended in a flurry of grievances and damp handshakes. Mr. Lionel Fawcett’s voice still echoed: ‘If we do not change, we perish.’

Now, Fawcett lay propped against the mossy stones, blood matting his hair, a candlestick—iron, ecclesiastical, and out of place—beside him. He was alive, but barely. PC Griggs hovered nearby, notebook in hand, looking uneasy.

A bloodied handkerchief, embroidered with a single ‘E,’ lay close. Hesslewick pocketed it without comment. The vestry, where the candlestick belonged, had been locked earlier—keys held by Mrs. Edith Mallow, parish secretary and known for her meticulousness.

Scene Two: The Cast Assembles

Mrs. Mallow arrived first, cheeks flushed, keys jangling at her waist. ‘I was in the kitchen, making tea for the committee. I never left the hall, Inspector. Not until I heard the shouting.’

Mr. Hugh Brackley, tweed immaculate, moustache bristling, followed. ‘I left before the meeting ended. Fawcett’s proposals are nonsense, but I don’t resort to violence. I was on the chalk road, heading home. Ask anyone.’

Miss Vera Linton, eyes bright and voice brittle, lingered at the edge. ‘I argued with Lionel, yes. But I’d never harm him. I was in the cloakroom, fixing my hair. Ask Mrs. Mallow—she saw me.’

Mr. Sidney Crane, the outsider, stood apart, hands in his pockets. ‘I left as soon as the meeting turned ugly. I was halfway to the bus stop when I heard the commotion. I came back to see if I could help.’

Scene Three: Hesslewick’s Rounds

Hesslewick moved from one to the next, questions gentle and precise. Mrs. Mallow insisted the vestry keys never left her person. ‘No one else touched them, Inspector. I’d stake my reputation.’

Brackley, when pressed, produced a half-eaten apple as proof of his walk. ‘Picked it myself from the lane. I saw a figure running, but the mist made it impossible to tell who.’

Vera Linton, smoothing her gloves, admitted her quarrel with Fawcett. ‘He was reckless, but he meant well. I was in the cloakroom, as I said. Edith saw me.’

Crane, asked about his abrupt departure, shrugged. ‘I’m not exactly welcome here. I thought it best to leave before tempers flared. I didn’t see anything until I returned.’

Scene Four: The Details

The vestry door was locked, the candlestick missing from its usual place. The handkerchief, bloodied and monogrammed, was the only tangible clue. The mist had rendered all sightings suspect.

Mrs. Mallow’s keys were accounted for, but Hesslewick noted a faint smear of blood on the largest one. She claimed it was from tending to Fawcett after the fact. Brackley’s apple was fresh, but the lane was on the opposite side of the hall from the lychgate. Vera’s gloves were spotless, her alibi dependent on Mrs. Mallow’s word. Crane’s coat was damp, but so was everyone’s.

Scene Five: The Challenge

Hesslewick gathered the group beneath the lychgate, the mist swirling at their feet. He recited their stories, each as plausible as the next. Yet something in the sequence—some detail, some slip—did not fit. He closed his notebook with a snap.

‘One of you is not where you claim to have been,’ he said. ‘And the truth, as ever, is in the details.’

What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The contradiction lies in Mrs. Mallow’s account. She claims to have never left the hall and that the vestry keys never left her person. Yet, she also provides Vera Linton’s alibi, saying she saw Vera in the cloakroom during the critical window. However, the cloakroom is adjacent to the vestry, and the only way Mrs. Mallow could have seen Vera there is if she herself was in or near the vestry at the time—contradicting her claim of being in the kitchen throughout.

Furthermore, the blood on Mrs. Mallow’s vestry key cannot be explained by her tending to Fawcett, as the vestry is some distance from the lychgate where Fawcett was found. The only way for blood to be on the key is if it was used to unlock the vestry after the attack, to return the candlestick, or if the attacker had blood on their hands when locking up.

The handkerchief with the initial ‘E’ is a red herring—Edith Mallow’s, yes, but she claims it was lost earlier in the day. The real clue is the time and location contradiction: Mrs. Mallow’s attempt to provide Vera with an alibi inadvertently places herself at the scene, with the means (the keys) and opportunity. Her motive—resentment over Fawcett’s reforms threatening her family’s farm—completes the picture.

Hesslewick deduces that Mrs. Mallow, in a moment of anger or desperation, took the candlestick from the vestry, attacked Fawcett, and then attempted to cover her tracks by providing Vera with an alibi and explaining away the blood on her keys. The mist and confusion of the evening allowed her to slip back into the hall unnoticed, but her story does not withstand scrutiny.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The characters are distinct, with motives and personalities that fit the social fabric of the time. The mist and the lychgate create a classic, almost gothic mood, and the structure—moving from scene to scene—builds tension effectively. Dialogue is period-appropriate and concise. The addition of the detective’s notes deepens immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle.

The puzzle is preserved: the clues are presented neutrally, and the suspects’ statements are plausible, with no overt hints. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to think critically without leading them to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Mrs. Mallow’s account is subtle but fair, and the blood on the key is a well-placed detail. The handkerchief as a red herring is handled deftly, and the motive is believable within the context of village politics. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful attention to the suspects’ statements and the geography of the scene.

Inconsistencies/Errors:

- The only minor issue is that the precise layout of the parish hall, vestry, and cloakroom is not described in detail, which could make the deduction slightly more challenging for some readers. However, the narrative provides enough context to infer the necessary relationships.
- All other elements are consistent with the time period and setting.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring close reading and attention to subtle contradictions in alibis and physical evidence.
