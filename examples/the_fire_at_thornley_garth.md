## Narrative

It was the sort of morning that made even the crows sound apologetic: low mist, a faint tang of smoke, and the milkman’s cart creaking up Mill Lane. Thornley Garth was not a village that welcomed drama, but the sight of Harold Pritchard’s timber-framed cottage—roof blackened, windows gaping—drew a small, silent crowd before breakfast.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived with his usual lack of ceremony, notebook in hand, coat buttoned to the chin. PC Griggs hovered nearby, looking as if he’d rather be anywhere else. The body of Harold Pritchard, orchard owner and local recluse, had been carried out an hour before, shrouded in a blanket. The cause: fire, started near the hearth, with the unmistakable scent of paraffin lingering in the air. No sign of forced entry. The insurance policy, recently altered, now named Stanley Pritchard—Harold’s estranged nephew—as beneficiary.

Hesslewick began with the milkman, Alfie Cobb, who had discovered the blaze. Alfie, a man whose face was as open as his milk ledger, recounted his routine: ‘I come by at half five, same as always. Saw the smoke, ran for help. Didn’t see a soul on the lane, not till Mrs. Larkin came out in her slippers.’

Mrs. Edith Larkin, next-door neighbour and self-appointed chronicler of village life, was eager to assist. ‘I saw Stanley last night, just after ten, loitering by Harold’s gate. Looked shifty, if you ask me. I told him Harold was likely asleep, but he just grunted and walked off. I heard nothing after that—well, except the wind. My windows rattle something dreadful.’

Stanley Pritchard, summoned from the pub’s back room, was pale and defensive. ‘I came by to talk to Uncle about the orchard—nothing more. He wouldn’t see me, so I left. I was home by half past ten. Ask anyone at the Red Lion.’

Vera Pritchard, Harold’s sister-in-law, arrived late, her eyes red-rimmed. ‘Harold and I disagreed, yes, but I’d never wish him harm. I was at home all night. Stanley’s had money troubles, but he’s not a killer. And Mrs. Larkin—well, she sees what she wants to see.’

Hesslewick walked the perimeter, noting the undisturbed flowerbeds, the locked back door, the faint paraffin trail leading from the shed to the hearth. He questioned Alfie again: ‘You’re sure you saw no one?’

‘No one, sir. Just Mrs. Larkin, after the fact. She’s always up before dawn, fussing with her roses.’

Mrs. Larkin bristled when asked about her morning. ‘I was up early, yes, but only because the smoke woke me. I opened my window and saw the flames. That’s when I called out for help.’

Hesslewick paused, considering the routines, the timings, the stories that almost fit. He lingered by the hearth, examining the scorched floorboards, the paraffin can tucked behind the woodpile, the clock on the mantelpiece—stopped at 2:17.

He gathered the villagers in the parlour, the air thick with smoke and suspicion. ‘Someone here knows more than they’re saying,’ he said, voice quiet but unyielding. ‘The truth is rarely convenient, but it is always persistent.’

He looked from face to face, waiting for the silence to settle. ‘There is one detail that does not fit. One thing that tells me who set the fire, and when.’

What has Inspector Hesslewick realised?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in Mrs. Larkin’s account. She claims to have been woken by the smoke and to have opened her window to see the flames, then called for help. However, Alfie the milkman—who discovered the fire at dawn—saw no one on the lane until Mrs. Larkin appeared in her slippers after he raised the alarm. If Mrs. Larkin had truly been woken by the fire and called for help, she would have been outside before Alfie arrived, not after. 

Furthermore, Mrs. Larkin is known for her early morning gardening, and the paraffin trail leads from the shed (which she shares access to) to the hearth. The stopped clock at 2:17 suggests the fire started much earlier than dawn, contradicting her story of being woken by smoke at first light. 

Mrs. Larkin’s knowledge of the fire’s timing and her delayed appearance are things she could not have known unless she was present at the scene before the fire was discovered. Her motive is less obvious, but as a neighbour who resented Harold’s neglect of the property (and perhaps with her own designs on the orchard), she had opportunity and access. The contradiction in her story—being woken by smoke but only appearing after the alarm—reveals her involvement. Hesslewick deduced that Mrs. Larkin set the fire in the early hours, returned home, and waited to emerge until she could blend in with the commotion, hoping suspicion would fall on Stanley instead.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 rural English village setting. The language and details are consistent with the era, and the characters are distinct, each with plausible motives and roles within the community. The puzzle is presented with clarity, and the clues are woven into the dialogue and observations rather than being overtly highlighted. The inclusion of the stopped clock, the paraffin trail, and the witness statements all serve to build a logical structure for deduction.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle or leading the reader to the solution. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on relationships and routines rather than hinting at guilt. The narrative is tight, with little extraneous detail, and the pacing supports the gradual revelation of inconsistencies.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Mrs. Larkin’s account is subtle but fair, and the physical evidence (paraffin trail, stopped clock) supports the timeline. The motive is plausible, if understated, and the reasoning for eliminating other suspects is sound. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful attention to witness statements and timings.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle is moderately challenging, relying on the reader’s ability to notice inconsistencies in testimony and to piece together the timeline from understated clues. It is not overly complex but avoids being too easy or obvious. The solution rewards attentive reading and logical deduction.

No major inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, immersive, and satisfying for a cosy crime puzzle.
