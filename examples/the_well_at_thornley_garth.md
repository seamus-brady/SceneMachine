## Narrative

Fog pressed thick against the hedgerows as Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the old tithe barn, his boots muffled by dew and the hush of a village holding its breath. The well behind the barn, unused for decades, had become the centre of Thornley Garth’s whispered dread. Now, with Miss Edith Lavington’s body at its foot, it was the scene of something altogether less genteel.

PC Griggs, lantern in hand, waited by the barn’s side door. “Found by young Sykes, sir. Just after ten. She’s down there—broken neck, looks like.”

Hesslewick nodded, eyes flicking to the muddy footprints leading from the barn’s side door to the well. A torn glove lay in the grass, and a broken brooch glinted in the lantern’s light. The fog made everything seem closer, secrets pressing in from all sides.

The cast assembled in the barn’s shadow: Mr. Harold Fenwick, stiff as his collar; Mrs. Agnes Barlow, red-eyed and clutching a handkerchief; Miss Clara Fenwick, arms folded, gaze fixed on the ground; and Tommy Sykes, shifting from foot to foot, cap in hand. Each had a reason to be here, and none seemed eager to explain it.

Hesslewick began with Harold Fenwick. “You were at home, Mr. Fenwick?”

“Of course. My daughter and I returned after the meeting. I was reading in my study. I heard nothing until the commotion.”

Clara Fenwick’s jaw tightened. “I left the hall after Miss Lavington. She was cycling ahead. I came straight home. Father can confirm.”

Mrs. Barlow dabbed her eyes. “I stayed to tidy the hall. Edith was upset, but she left alone. I locked up and walked home—didn’t see a soul.”

Tommy Sykes shuffled. “I was fetching tools for Mr. Fenwick, sir. Saw the bicycle by the barn, then—well, I saw her down there. Ran for Griggs.”

Hesslewick walked the path from the barn’s side door to the well. The footprints were muddied, but small, likely a woman’s. The torn glove was delicate, the brooch cheap paste. The bicycle, abandoned by the barn, had a bent wheel and a basket half-full of Women’s Institute pamphlets.

He spoke with each again, quietly. Clara’s shoes were spotless, despite the mud. Mrs. Barlow’s gloves were intact. Harold Fenwick’s boots bore a crust of dried earth, but not the barn’s sticky clay. Tommy’s hands were clean, but his trousers were splashed with mud.

Hesslewick paused at the well, notebook in hand. The struggle must have been brief. The glove and brooch suggested a scuffle, but the footprints told a different story. He looked up at the barn’s side door, then back at the group.

“Miss Lavington was last seen alive just before ten,” he said. “Yet her bicycle is here, and the path from the barn is muddied by only one set of prints. Curious, isn’t it?”

The fog thickened, and the village seemed to draw closer, listening. Hesslewick’s gaze lingered on Clara Fenwick, then shifted to Mrs. Barlow, who flinched.

He closed his notebook. “One thing does not fit. One story cannot be true.”

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect Mrs. Barlow? What detail in her account cannot be reconciled with the evidence at the scene?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s suspicion falls on Mrs. Barlow because of a contradiction between her account and the physical evidence. She claimed to have left the church hall after Miss Lavington, tidied up, and walked home, seeing no one. However, the only muddy footprints leading from the barn’s side door to the well were small and likely a woman’s—matching Mrs. Barlow’s size. Clara’s shoes were spotless, and her alibi (confirmed by her father) placed her at home. Mrs. Barlow’s gloves were intact, but a torn glove was found at the scene, suggesting she lost it during a struggle. The clincher: Mrs. Barlow said she locked up the hall and walked home, but the only plausible way for Miss Lavington’s bicycle to end up by the barn was if someone intercepted her before she reached home. Mrs. Barlow, having stayed behind, had the opportunity to follow Edith, confront her by the barn, and after the fatal struggle, attempt to cover her tracks. The muddy footprints, torn glove, and her inconsistent timeline reveal Mrs. Barlow’s involvement.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting, with period-appropriate details and a strong sense of place. The cast of suspects is clearly introduced, each with plausible roles and personalities. The detective’s investigation is methodical and in character for Hesslewick, using observation and subtle psychological pressure. The clues—footprints, glove, brooch, and timelines—are presented fairly, without overtly leading the reader to the solution. The questions at the end are open-ended and do not spoil the puzzle.

The solution is logical and deducible from the narrative: Mrs. Barlow’s account is undermined by the physical evidence (footprints, glove, and the bicycle’s location). The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable, requiring careful attention to detail and the elimination of other suspects. The only minor weakness is that the torn glove clue is slightly underplayed in the narrative, but this does not significantly detract from the solvability. The level of difficulty is moderate, requiring attentive reading but not advanced deduction.
