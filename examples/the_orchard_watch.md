## Narrative

It was the sort of June night that made even the hawthorn hedges seem conspiratorial, their shadows pooling along the chalk lane behind the disused smithy. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned from his solitary cottage by the urgent barking of Mrs. Prowse’s terrier, found the orchard already thick with whispers.

Mr. Lionel Fawkes, the new schoolmaster, lay sprawled beneath a gnarled apple tree, his pocket watch stopped at seven minutes past midnight. The orchard, rarely visited after dusk, was now the centre of Thornley Garth’s attention. Hesslewick, hands clasped behind his back, surveyed the scene with the air of a man inspecting a poorly made clock.

Mrs. Edith Prowse, cheeks flushed with the thrill of discovery, recounted her tale for the third time. “Baxter wouldn’t settle, Inspector. He kept pulling toward the orchard. I thought perhaps a fox, but—well, there he was. Poor Mr. Fawkes. I ran for Henry at once.”

Henry Prowse, retired blacksmith and owner of the nearest cottage, stood nearby, arms folded. “Didn’t hear a thing, Inspector. Not so much as a twig snapped. Edith’s the one with the ears in this house.”

Arthur Tilling, the farmhand, loitered at the orchard’s edge, boots muddy and jaw set. He had been seen arguing with Fawkes at the King’s Arms earlier that evening—something about Miss Ivy Hargreaves, the vicar’s daughter. Ivy herself, pale and composed, arrived soon after, her eyes flicking from the body to Arthur, then away.

Hesslewick began his circuit, notebook in hand. “Miss Hargreaves, you spoke with Mr. Fawkes tonight?”

She nodded. “In the churchyard, just after ten. He wished to apologise for the scene at the pub. I left him there. I went straight home—Father can confirm.”

Arthur’s account was less polished. “I left the pub after Fawkes. Saw him heading this way, but I turned off for the lane. Didn’t want more words. Got home before midnight. My mother’ll tell you.”

Mrs. Prowse interjected, “I saw Arthur on the lane, Inspector. He looked in a hurry.”

Henry Prowse, meanwhile, insisted he had been reading by the fire. “Didn’t leave my chair. Edith’ll say the same.”

Hesslewick examined the body. No sign of a struggle, save for a single blow to the head. The grass was flattened in a neat arc, as if someone had stood over Fawkes for a moment before departing. No weapon in sight.

He noted the stopped watch, the absence of mud on Fawkes’s shoes, and a faint scent of pipe tobacco—unusual, as Fawkes was known to prefer cigarettes. He asked Mrs. Prowse if she’d seen anyone else. “No, Inspector. Only Arthur, and he was moving away from the orchard.”

The night deepened. Hesslewick walked the orchard’s perimeter, pausing by the smithy’s broken door. He found nothing but an old horseshoe and a scattering of pipe ash near the gate. Returning, he watched as Ivy and Arthur exchanged a glance—guilt, or something else?

At dawn, the village gathered in uneasy knots. Hesslewick, notebook closed, addressed them with his usual brevity. “The truth is rarely where we expect it. I believe I know how Mr. Fawkes met his end.”

What detail led Hesslewick to his conclusion?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the pipe tobacco and the pipe ash found near the orchard gate. Fawkes was known to smoke only cigarettes, yet the scent of pipe tobacco lingered on his clothes and pipe ash was found at the scene. Of the villagers, only Henry Prowse is known to smoke a pipe. Henry claimed he heard nothing and never left his chair, but the presence of his pipe ash outside contradicts this. Furthermore, the orchard is directly behind his cottage, making it easy for him to slip out unnoticed. The absence of mud on Fawkes’s shoes suggests he was lured to the orchard by someone he trusted or who lived nearby—Henry. The arc in the grass indicates someone stood over Fawkes after the blow, perhaps to retrieve the weapon or check the watch. Henry’s insistence that he heard nothing is suspicious, given the proximity. The red herrings—Arthur’s argument, Ivy’s secret meeting, and Mrs. Prowse’s discovery—distract from the simple truth: Henry was present at the scene, his pipe giving him away. Hesslewick deduced that Henry, perhaps resentful of Fawkes’s modern ways or protective of village tradition, struck the fatal blow and returned home before his wife raised the alarm.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, capturing the social dynamics and investigative style of Inspector Hesslewick. The suspects are well-drawn, with plausible motives and alibis. The clues are subtly embedded: the pipe tobacco, pipe ash, and the absence of mud on Fawkes’s shoes are fair and logical. The red herrings (Arthur’s argument, Ivy’s meeting) are effective, and the solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure. The puzzle is solvable by attentive readers, though it requires careful attention to detail. The only minor weakness is that Henry’s alibi relies on his wife, which could be more robustly challenged in the narrative. Overall, the story is tight, immersive, and fair. Difficulty: 7/10.
