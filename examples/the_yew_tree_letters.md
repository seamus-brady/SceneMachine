## Narrative

It was a June night in Thornley Garth, the air thick with elderflower and the promise of rain. Beneath the ancient yew in St. Jude’s churchyard, Mrs. Edith Larch stood with gloved hands trembling around a battered envelope. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick lingered in the shadows, notebook poised. PC Griggs, uniform creased and moustache bristling, paced the gravel path, boots crunching with each circuit.

Blackmail letters had arrived over several weeks, each hinting at a scandal in Mrs. Larch’s past—never explicit, always just enough to chill the blood. The final note demanded payment, to be left at the base of the yew tree at midnight. Only a handful knew of the sting: Mrs. Larch, her neighbour Mrs. Clara Finch (who insisted on accompanying her), PC Griggs, and Reverend Lionel March, who offered the churchyard as a discreet meeting place. Arthur Pimm, a young man with debts and a reputation for bad luck, was apprehended by Griggs as he reached for the envelope.

Hesslewick began his inquiry at dawn, when the dew still clung to the grass and the village was quiet but for the crows. He spoke first to Mrs. Larch, who was pale and exhausted. She insisted she had told no one but Clara Finch of the letters, and had only confided in the vicar after Clara’s urging. Clara, brisk and practical, confirmed this, though she seemed preoccupied with Mrs. Larch’s nerves. Reverend March, mild and apologetic, said he had agreed to the late-night arrangement reluctantly, but had been in the vestry all evening, preparing his Sunday sermon. Arthur Pimm, sullen and unshaven, denied writing the letters but admitted he’d heard whispers of Mrs. Larch’s supposed scandal from his late mother, who had once worked in the Larch household.

Hesslewick walked the churchyard, noting footprints in the soft earth, a broken twig near the yew, and the faint smell of pipe tobacco. He questioned each party about their movements that night. Mrs. Larch and Clara arrived together at a quarter to midnight; Griggs had been stationed behind the lychgate since eleven; Reverend March claimed he had not left the vestry after ten. Arthur Pimm was seen by no one until he appeared at the tree.

Yet something did not fit. Clara Finch, in her careful account, mentioned seeing the vicar’s study lamp burning as she and Mrs. Larch approached the churchyard, though the vestry window faces away from the path. Arthur Pimm, for all his bluster, seemed genuinely surprised to learn the letters referenced details only Mrs. Larch and her late husband could have known. The pipe tobacco—distinctly Reverend March’s blend—lingered near the yew, though the vicar claimed not to have left the vestry.

Hesslewick gathered the group beneath the yew at noon, the village watching from a respectful distance. He recited the facts, his voice as dry as chalk dust. Then he closed his notebook and looked, not at Arthur Pimm, but at another.

Who does Hesslewick suspect, and why?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick suspects Reverend Lionel March. The key clue is the pipe tobacco near the yew tree—March’s distinctive blend—despite his claim not to have left the vestry. Clara Finch’s statement that she saw the vicar’s study lamp burning as she and Mrs. Larch approached is a red herring, as the vestry window faces away from the path and could not be seen from where they walked. This suggests Clara was mistaken or lying, but more importantly, it highlights that the vicar’s movements were not as fixed as he claimed.

The real telling detail is the tobacco: only March smokes that blend, and it was found at the scene of the drop. Arthur Pimm, though apprehended at the tree, was likely tipped off about the payment by someone else—possibly March, who had access to Mrs. Larch’s confidences through his pastoral role. March orchestrated the blackmail, using his knowledge of the family’s secrets and his position to manipulate others. He planted the letters and arranged for Pimm to collect the money, hoping to deflect suspicion onto the desperate young man.

Hesslewick’s deduction rests on the physical impossibility of the tobacco being present if March had not been at the tree, and the knowledge in the letters being too intimate for anyone but a close confidant or someone with privileged access. The vicar’s mild demeanor and apparent reluctance were a mask for his involvement.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, capturing the social dynamics and character archetypes of the period. The puzzle is well-constructed, with a limited suspect pool and clues that are subtle but fair. The inclusion of the pipe tobacco as a distinguishing clue is classic and period-appropriate, and the red herring regarding the vestry lamp adds complexity without being misleading.

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative: the tobacco at the scene, the vicar’s unique access to Mrs. Larch’s secrets, and the inconsistencies in alibis all point to Reverend March. The puzzle avoids triviality by requiring careful attention to character statements and physical evidence, and it does not rely on coincidence or implausible deductions. The difficulty is moderate, as the clues are present but require synthesis and critical reading. There are no significant inconsistencies or errors; the story is coherent and the solution satisfying.

Difficulty: 6/10.
