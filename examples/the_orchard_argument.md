## Narrative

Evening settled over Thornley Garth with the hush of a village holding its breath. The old Bramley orchard, half-choked with nettles and the ghosts of better harvests, lay at the edge of things, beyond the last cottage, behind the disused cider press, where the grass grew long and the air tasted faintly of iron and apples. On the evening of June 14th, 1937, Albert Preece was found dead, a rusted spanner beside his head and a faded photograph clutched in his hand.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived as the last light drained from the sky, his coat buttoned to the throat and his notebook already open. PC Griggs, red-faced and puffing, met him by the orchard gate. "Nasty business, sir. Found him myself. Thomas Liddell’s waiting by the press. Says he did it, but not on purpose."

Hesslewick nodded, eyes flicking to the cider press, its wheel frozen, its wood silvered by years of rain. He took in the scene: Albert sprawled awkwardly, the photograph of his late wife pressed to his chest. The spanner, heavy and pitted, lay just out of reach. No sign of a struggle, no footprints but the ones leading in and out from the gate.

He spoke first with Thomas Liddell, who stood with his hands jammed in his pockets, eyes fixed on the ground. "We argued, yes. He was in a state, kept going on about Margaret, wouldn’t listen. I tried to calm him, but he lashed out. I grabbed for him, he stumbled, and I suppose I must have struck him with the spanner. Didn’t mean to. I swear it."

Edith Liddell hovered nearby, wringing her handkerchief. "Albert’s not been himself since Margaret passed. I tried to get between them earlier, but they wouldn’t have it. Thomas wouldn’t hurt him, not truly. He’s just, well, he’s not himself either."

PC Griggs recounted his own arrival: "Heard the shouting from the lane. By the time I got here, it was quiet. Found Thomas kneeling by Albert, looking fit to be sick. The spanner was there, plain as day."

Hesslewick walked the orchard, noting the trampled grass, the way the cider press cast a long shadow over the scene. He asked Edith where she’d been. "At home, mostly. I heard them from the kitchen, but by the time I got here, it was over. I saw Thomas standing over Albert."

He questioned Thomas again. "Did you pick up the spanner before or after the quarrel?"

Thomas hesitated. "I suppose before. It was lying there, and I thought Albert might hurt himself. He was in a bad way."

Hesslewick nodded, jotting a note. He asked about the photograph. Edith said, "Margaret gave it to him years ago. He’s never without it."

The evening deepened. Hesslewick stood by the cider press, watching the cottages light up one by one. He asked Griggs, "Anyone else seen near the orchard?"

"No, sir. Only the three of them, far as I know."

Hesslewick closed his notebook. The orchard was silent but for the wind in the branches. He looked once more at the spanner, the photograph, the pressed grass, and the faces of the living.

He turned to the group, voice mild. "There’s something here that doesn’t quite fit. I wonder if any of you can see it."

Why does Inspector Hesslewick doubt Thomas Liddell’s account? What detail in the orchard scene troubles him?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick doubts Thomas Liddell’s account because of a subtle but crucial inconsistency regarding the spanner. Thomas claims he picked up the spanner before the quarrel, fearing Albert might harm himself. However, when the body was found, the spanner was lying just out of Albert’s reach, not in Thomas’s possession or anywhere it might have been dropped in a scuffle. If Thomas had truly picked up the spanner before the altercation, it would not have ended up so neatly beside Albert after the incident unless Thomas had deliberately placed it there to stage the scene. Furthermore, there were no signs of a struggle or any indication that Albert had tried to seize the spanner from Thomas. The grass was only pressed down where Albert fell, not where a fight might have occurred. This suggests that Thomas’s story is constructed to make the death appear accidental, but the physical evidence—the position of the spanner and the lack of disturbance—contradicts his account. Hesslewick realizes that Thomas, in his panic or guilt, tried to create a plausible story, but overlooked the simple logic of where the spanner should have been if events had unfolded as he described.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, immersing the reader in the rural melancholy of Thornley Garth and the emotional tension of the characters. The setting and period details are consistent and evocative, and the dialogue feels authentic to the era. The puzzle is presented cleanly, with each character’s perspective and emotional state contributing to the ambiguity of the incident. The detective’s methodical approach is well-portrayed, and the open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle’s integrity.

The addition of detective notes enhances immersion, summarizing key facts and suspects without tipping the reader toward the solution. The suspect list is neutral and focused on roles and relationships, not clues.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and rooted in the physical evidence described in the narrative. The contradiction in Thomas’s account regarding the spanner’s position is subtle but fair, and the lack of struggle or disturbance supports the inspector’s doubt. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful reading and inference, rewarding attention to detail.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle is moderately challenging, relying on the reader’s ability to notice inconsistencies in witness statements and physical evidence. It is solvable with close attention but not immediately obvious, making it satisfying for fans of classic cosy crime.
