## Narrative

Scene One: The Churchyard at Dawn

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick stands beneath the yew trees behind St. Agnes, the April air sharp with the scent of wet earth and primroses. The grave of Edwin Snaith gapes open, its iron gate left ajar. Muddy footprints—some large, some small—track a path from the lychgate to the torn shroud in the empty casket. Lantern glass glints in the grass. The village wakes uneasy: a body stolen, a will contested, and forged documents whispered about in every parlour.

Scene Two: The Snaith Cottage

Mrs. Clara Snaith, widow, pours tea with a hand that never quite stops trembling. She insists she was home all night, reading by the fire. Her relationship with her late husband’s nephew, Harold, is brittle as old bone china. Clara claims she never saw the will until the day it was read. She dabs her eyes, but Hesslewick notes the lack of tears.

Scene Three: The Village Green

Mr. Harold Snaith, nephew, paces the green, voice raised for any who’ll listen. He rails against Clara, accusing her of manipulation and greed. He admits to walking past the churchyard late at night, but only, he says, to clear his head. He claims he saw a lantern moving among the graves, but couldn’t make out who carried it. His boots are caked with mud, but so are half the villagers’ this time of year.

Scene Four: The Schoolhouse

Miss Ivy Griggs, schoolteacher and daughter of PC Griggs, is found sorting correspondence. She handled some of Edwin’s letters, she admits, and saw the will once—briefly, she insists—when Mr. Pritchard asked her to type a copy. She blushes when Hesslewick asks about the forged documents, and says she was home marking essays the night of the incident. Her shoes are clean, but her fingers are ink-stained.

Scene Five: The Solicitor’s Office

Mr. Lionel Pritchard, the village solicitor, polishes his spectacles and speaks in measured tones. He was responsible for reading the will and verifying its authenticity. He claims to have spent the evening preparing paperwork for another client. He is under scrutiny for the forged documents, but insists he only ever saw the original will. He mentions, offhand, that the lantern in the churchyard is likely the old one from the vestry—he saw it missing the morning after the theft.

Scene Six: The Churchyard Again

Hesslewick walks the graveyard with PC Griggs, notebook in hand. He notes the footprints, the torn shroud, the lantern glass. He asks Griggs about the vestry lantern—when was it last seen? Griggs shrugs: he never checks the vestry after dark. Hesslewick stands by the open grave, eyes narrowed, as the church bell tolls for morning prayers.

Challenge:

Inspector Hesslewick gathers the villagers in the churchyard. He asks each, quietly, about their movements, their knowledge of the will, and the lantern. He listens for what is said—and what is not. Something in their stories does not fit. What has Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the lantern and the knowledge of its absence. Only someone who had been in the vestry after the incident could know the lantern was missing. Mr. Pritchard, the solicitor, mentioned the vestry lantern was missing the morning after the theft—yet no one had reported it missing, and the vestry is kept locked at night. For him to know it was gone, he must have entered the vestry after the crime, or been present during it. This knowledge is something he should not have had unless he was involved. The muddy footprints and the forged documents are red herrings—many villagers had muddy boots, and several had access to Edwin’s correspondence. The real clue is Pritchard’s slip: he revealed knowledge he could not have had unless he was present at the scene. Hesslewick deduces that Pritchard, fearing exposure over the forged documents, exhumed the body to destroy evidence, using the vestry lantern to light his way. His attempt to implicate others by mentioning the lantern only revealed his own guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The scenes are concise, each introducing a suspect and their relationship to the deceased and the will. The language is consistent with the period, and the details—such as the muddy ground, the lantern glass, and the strained relationships—are evocative. The puzzle is preserved, with each suspect given plausible motives and alibis, and no overt clues are given away in the narrative or the detective’s notes. The inclusion of the detective’s notes deepens immersion and provides a structured summary without biasing the reader.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains a clear, logical flow. The open-ended challenge at the end is well-phrased, inviting the reader to consider inconsistencies without leading them to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and fair. The critical clue—Pritchard’s knowledge of the missing vestry lantern—can be deduced from the narrative, as no one else had reason or opportunity to know it was gone. The muddy footprints and forged documents serve as effective red herrings, and the reasoning for Pritchard’s guilt is sound. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

The puzzle requires careful reading and inference, but all necessary information is present. It is moderately challenging, suitable for readers familiar with the genre.

No inconsistencies or errors were found in the narrative or solution. The setting, character motivations, and clues are coherent and consistent with the time period.
