## Narrative

Fog pressed against the hedgerows as Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the edge of the old orchard, his boots sinking into the June mud. PC Griggs, lantern in hand, hovered by the smithy’s broken gate, his cap askew. Beyond, the orchard’s gnarled trees loomed, their branches clutching at the mist.

Mrs. Edith Palmer, widow and lately a recluse, lay propped against a mossy stone, her face pale beneath a bloodied handkerchief. Her left arm was crudely bandaged with another, and Hesslewick noted the second, unfamiliar handkerchief—partially bloodied—discarded in the hedgerow. A shattered laudanum bottle glinted near her feet, and a kitchen knife, its blade streaked with red, rested in the grass.

Tom Liddell, the young villager who’d found her, shifted from foot to foot, his boots caked in orchard mud. He’d been returning from the late bus, he said, when he heard a cry and saw Mrs. Palmer slumped by the hedge. He’d run for Griggs at once.

Griggs, ever the proceduralist, recounted his arrival: Mrs. Palmer was conscious but confused, mumbling about ‘shadows’ and ‘voices.’ He’d found the scene much as it was now, save for Tom’s muddy footprints leading from the lane.

Mr. Charles Harker, the city stranger, arrived soon after, summoned by Griggs. His overcoat was immaculate, his accent clipped. He claimed to have been at the inn all evening, reading in the lounge. He admitted to knowing Mrs. Palmer—‘purely business, a matter of property’—but denied any quarrel.

Mrs. Agnes Blythe, neighbor and erstwhile friend, appeared last, breathless and bristling. She’d seen ‘a figure’ in the orchard from her window, she insisted, but couldn’t say who. She and Mrs. Palmer had quarreled recently over a disputed inheritance, but she dismissed this as ‘old women’s nonsense.’

Hesslewick began his rounds. Tom’s account was straightforward: he’d returned from Brighton on the late bus, cut across the orchard, and found Mrs. Palmer. He’d never seen the laudanum bottle before, nor the second handkerchief. His boots, large and muddied, matched the prints near the scene, but so would any man’s in the village, he pointed out, and he’d come from the lane, not the hedgerow.

Griggs, for his part, had been on patrol, seen nothing amiss until Tom fetched him. He’d known Mrs. Palmer for years, found her ‘odd lately, but not desperate.’ He’d noticed the second handkerchief but assumed it was Mrs. Palmer’s until Hesslewick pointed out the embroidered initials: ‘A.B.’

Harker, when pressed, grew defensive. He’d been at the inn from seven o’clock, with the landlord as witness. He’d visited Mrs. Palmer earlier that afternoon to discuss the sale of her late husband’s orchard, but left before tea. He denied owning laudanum or ever carrying a handkerchief. His shoes, polished and narrow, showed no trace of mud.

Mrs. Blythe, meanwhile, insisted she’d been home all evening, darning by the window. She’d seen a ‘tall figure’ moving in the fog—‘not Tom, too broad in the shoulders’—but her eyesight, she admitted, was ‘not what it was.’ She’d visited Mrs. Palmer that morning, left in a temper, and hadn’t returned. The handkerchief, she conceded, was hers, but she’d ‘misplaced it days ago.’

As dawn crept over the orchard, Hesslewick walked the scene once more, notebook in hand. The laudanum bottle, the knife, the two handkerchiefs, the footprints—each detail slotted into place. He paused by the hedgerow, considering the fog, the footprints, and the stories told.

He gathered the group by the smithy’s gate. ‘One of you,’ he said quietly, ‘knows precisely what happened here. The rest, I suspect, know rather less than they claim.’

What has Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s deduction hinges on the second, partially bloodied handkerchief embroidered with ‘A.B.’—Mrs. Blythe’s initials. Mrs. Blythe claims she lost it days ago, but it was found freshly bloodied at the scene, used to bind Mrs. Palmer’s wounds. Mrs. Palmer’s own handkerchief was also used, but the second was not hers.

The key clue is that Mrs. Palmer’s wounds were hastily bound with both handkerchiefs, suggesting her attacker attempted to staunch the bleeding after the fact—an odd act for an attempted murderer, but plausible if the attack was impulsive or if the assailant panicked. The laudanum bottle, shattered, suggests an attempt to stage a suicide, but Mrs. Palmer’s injuries are inconsistent with self-infliction: the wounds are awkwardly placed for a right-handed woman, and the knife was left at the scene.

The muddy footprints are too large for Mrs. Palmer’s boots and do not match Harker’s narrow, polished shoes. Tom’s boots are muddy, but his route and timeline are corroborated by Griggs and the bus schedule. Griggs himself was on patrol and has no motive.

Mrs. Blythe, however, has motive (the inheritance dispute), opportunity (she lives next door and saw a ‘figure’ in the orchard), and her handkerchief was used at the scene. Her claim to have lost it days ago is undermined by its fresh bloodstains and presence at the scene. Her description of the ‘tall figure’ is a red herring—she could not have seen herself, and her poor eyesight is well known.

Hesslewick realizes Mrs. Blythe confronted Mrs. Palmer in the orchard, the quarrel turned violent, and in the aftermath, she attempted to bind the wounds and stage a suicide using the laudanum. The presence of her handkerchief, the time inconsistency in her story, and the physical evidence all point to her guilt. The other suspects’ alibis and lack of physical connection to the scene eliminate them.

Thus, Mrs. Blythe is the attacker, her guilt revealed by the very handkerchief she claimed to have lost.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric, consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, and tightly constructed. The inclusion of detective notes deepens immersion and clarifies the structure without spoiling the puzzle. The suspects are introduced with plausible motives and alibis, and the clues are distributed fairly: the handkerchief, the footprints, the timeline, and the laudanum bottle all serve as logical anchors for deduction.

The solution is logical and satisfying. The use of the handkerchief as a central clue is classic but not overly obvious, and the layering of motive, opportunity, and physical evidence is well handled. The red herring of Mrs. Blythe's eyesight and her claim about the handkerchief are plausible misdirections. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it requires careful attention to detail but does not hinge on obscure knowledge or unfair trickery.

Minor improvements could include slightly more detail on the footprints (size, direction) and a touch more ambiguity in the suspects' statements to increase difficulty. However, the puzzle as presented is fair and engaging.

Difficulty: 6/10. The puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring careful reading and logical deduction, but all necessary information is present in the narrative.
