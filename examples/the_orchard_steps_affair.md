## Narrative

The storm had not yet broken when Mrs. Edith Lavington was found at the foot of her own orchard steps, blood matting her silver hair and a fireplace poker—her own, unmistakably—lying nearby. The orchard behind her ivy-clad cottage was slick with June rain, the grass trampled and muddy. PC Griggs, summoned by Mrs. Agnes Broome’s frantic banging on his door, had already cordoned off the steps with a length of baler twine by the time Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived, coat collar turned up against the wind.

Hesslewick surveyed the scene with his usual, unhurried scrutiny. Mrs. Lavington, the village’s last squire’s daughter, had made herself unpopular of late: tenancy agreements refused, tempers frayed, and more than one villager muttering about her high-handedness. Now she lay unconscious, the storm threatening to wash away what little evidence remained.

The cast assembled in the cottage’s cramped parlour, each damp and defensive. Mr. Harold Pike, tenant farmer, boots caked with mud, stared at the hearth as if it might offer absolution. Miss Clara Finch, the housekeeper, fussed over a tray of tea, her hands trembling just enough to rattle the cups. Mr. George Tiller, broad-shouldered and red-eyed, claimed he’d been at the pub until midnight but had no one to vouch for his whereabouts after. Mrs. Broome, neighbour and self-appointed chronicler of village scandal, dabbed theatrically at her eyes and insisted she’d seen a shadowy figure fleeing toward the workers’ cottages.

Hesslewick began with the practicalities. The poker, usually kept in the drawing room, was now bloodied and out of place. Muddy footprints led away from the steps, but the rain had blurred their edges. Raised voices had been heard earlier—though no one could agree on whose. The storm, it seemed, had conspired with the assailant.

He spoke first with Pike, who admitted to arguing with Mrs. Lavington about his tenancy but insisted he’d been in his own cottage, nursing a bottle and his grievances, when the attack occurred. Clara Finch, loyal but weary, said she’d been preparing Mrs. Lavington’s cocoa in the kitchen and had only stepped out to fetch apples from the orchard earlier in the evening. George Tiller, whose family’s eviction years before was village legend, claimed he’d left the pub in a foul mood but had walked straight home, avoiding the Lavington property entirely. Mrs. Broome, ever the observer, maintained she’d glimpsed a figure—"tall, perhaps a man, but it was raining so, you know how it is"—and had rushed to the scene when she heard a cry.

Hesslewick’s questions were gentle, almost absent-minded. He noted Pike’s boots, the faint scent of apples on Clara’s apron, the way Tiller’s hands shook when he lit a cigarette. He asked Mrs. Broome, almost as an afterthought, why she’d been out so late in the storm. She replied she’d been closing her chickens in, though the henhouse was dry and undisturbed.

As the evening wore on, inconsistencies emerged. Pike’s boots were muddy, but not with orchard clay. Clara’s apron was damp, but her shoes were clean. Tiller’s alibi was thin, but he seemed genuinely surprised by the attack. Mrs. Broome’s account of the fleeing figure grew more elaborate with each telling, yet she’d been the first to arrive—before anyone else had even heard the commotion.

Hesslewick lingered at the orchard steps, notebook in hand, as the storm finally broke. He traced the footprints, considered the poker’s unlikely journey, and watched the rain wash away the last traces of violence. In the end, it was not what was present, but what was absent, that led him to his quiet conclusion.

What detail did Hesslewick notice that others missed?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in Mrs. Broome’s account and the physical evidence. She claimed to have seen a figure fleeing toward the workers’ cottages and to have arrived first at the scene. However, the muddy footprints led away from the orchard steps toward the cottages, not toward Mrs. Broome’s own house. If Mrs. Broome had truly been the first to arrive, her own footprints should have been visible approaching from the opposite direction. Yet, no such tracks were found—only those leading away. The storm had not yet washed them away when Hesslewick arrived, so her absence from the mud is telling.

Furthermore, Mrs. Broome’s story changed subtly with each telling, growing more dramatic and detailed, a classic sign of fabrication. Her reason for being out—"closing in the chickens"—does not hold up, as the henhouse was dry and undisturbed. The real clue is the environmental mismatch: Mrs. Broome could not have arrived first from her own house without leaving tracks, and her story about the chickens is a red herring. She invented the fleeing figure to deflect suspicion and explain the footprints, but in doing so, revealed her own guilt. Hesslewick deduced that Mrs. Broome, motivated by resentment or some private quarrel, struck Mrs. Lavington and staged the scene, counting on the storm to erase her tracks and the village’s willingness to believe in shadows.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, tightly written, and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The cast of suspects is well-drawn, each with plausible motives and alibis that are neither too obvious nor too obscure. The clues are embedded naturally in the dialogue and description, and the pacing allows the reader to absorb the details without feeling rushed. The inclusion of subtle inconsistencies—such as the direction of footprints, the state of the henhouse, and the evolving witness account—provides a fair challenge without being heavy-handed. The detective’s investigative style is well integrated, and the open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle’s integrity.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical, fair, and deducible from the narrative. The absence of Mrs. Broome’s footprints is a classic negative clue, and her shifting story is a credible indicator of guilt. The environmental details (rain, mud, undisturbed henhouse) are used effectively to support the conclusion. The motive is plausible, and the method of misdirection (inventing a fleeing figure) is believable for the character. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable; it rewards careful reading and attention to detail.

Difficulty Rating: 7/10

This puzzle requires attentive reading and inference, but all necessary information is present. The challenge is appropriate for experienced readers of cosy crime fiction.

No major inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, immersive, and satisfying.
