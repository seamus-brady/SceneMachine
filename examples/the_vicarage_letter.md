## Narrative

The dusk in Thornley Garth made even the hedgerows seem to lean in, listening. At the vicarage, Mrs. Edith Lavington stood in the kitchen, the blackmail letter spread on the table like a surgical specimen. The handwriting trembled, but the words were sharp: withdraw your support for the Captain’s memorial, or the truth will out. No demand for money, only silence.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived with his usual air of reluctant necessity, notebook open. PC Griggs hovered, hearing aid whistling faintly, while Reverend Arthur Pym poured tea with the solemnity of a man baptizing a cat. Miss Clara Finch, schoolteacher and memorial critic, sat rigidly upright, her hat at a militant angle. Sidney Blunt, the publican, had come at Griggs’s request, protesting that he’d been at the bar all evening and couldn’t possibly know anything, but eager to listen nonetheless.

Hesslewick began with the letter. “Left at the back door, you say?” Mrs. Lavington nodded. “I found it at half past seven, just after the bell for Evensong.”

He asked each where they’d been. Reverend Pym had been in the vestry, preparing his sermon. Clara Finch claimed to have been marking essays at home. Sidney Blunt insisted he’d not left the pub since five. Griggs had been on his rounds, which mostly meant a slow circuit of the green and a chat with Mrs. Dalloway about her missing cat.

Hesslewick walked the vicarage grounds, noting the muddy path by the back gate. “Anyone come by this way?” he asked. Pym shook his head. “Only the milkman, and he’s gone by six.”

He spoke to Clara Finch in the garden. She bristled. “I opposed the memorial, yes, but I wouldn’t stoop to anonymous threats. I said my piece at the council meeting.”

Blunt recounted the pub’s evening: “Busy enough, what with the darts match. I never saw Clara, if that’s what you’re thinking.”

Griggs, when pressed, admitted he’d seen a figure near the vicarage at dusk, “but it might’ve been a shadow, or a trick of the light. My hearing’s not what it was, nor my eyes.”

Hesslewick lingered on the letter. The phrase, ‘the truth must not be tarnished by false remembrance,’ struck him as oddly formal. He asked Pym about it. The vicar hesitated. “It sounds almost like something from the Captain’s own letters. He was a man of strong opinions.”

As the evening drew in, Hesslewick gathered them in the vicarage parlour. He recited the timeline: Mrs. Lavington in the kitchen at seven-thirty, Pym in the vestry, Finch at home, Blunt at the pub, Griggs on patrol. Yet the letter had appeared, unseen, at the back door.

He asked Clara about her essays. She flushed. “History papers. I lost track of time.”

He asked Blunt about the darts match. “We lost, as usual. I poured the last pint at half past seven.”

He asked Pym if anyone had come to the vestry. “No one, Inspector. I was quite alone.”

Hesslewick’s gaze lingered on the vicar’s hands, ink-stained and trembling slightly. He asked, almost idly, “Did you know the Captain well?”

Pym nodded. “He was a friend. I only wish his memory could rest.”

The room settled into silence, the only sound the ticking of the vicarage clock. Hesslewick closed his notebook. “The truth, it seems, is a restless guest in Thornley Garth.”

He left them with a question: Who could have delivered the letter, and what detail does not fit their story?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick deduced that Reverend Arthur Pym was the author of the letter. The crucial clue lay in the phrase, 'the truth must not be tarnished by false remembrance,' which echoed the formal, almost ecclesiastical language of the vicar himself and was reminiscent of Captain Lavington’s own correspondence, as Pym admitted.

The timeline revealed that Pym claimed to be alone in the vestry at the time the letter was delivered. However, the vestry is directly accessible to the vicarage garden via a private path known only to those familiar with the grounds, such as the vicar. Pym could have easily slipped out, left the letter at the back door, and returned to the vestry unnoticed. His ink-stained, trembling hands matched the letter’s handwriting, and his motivation was clear: as a friend of the Captain, he feared that the memorial would revive damaging rumors about the Captain’s wartime conduct, which Pym had learned in confidence. By anonymously threatening Mrs. Lavington, he hoped to protect both her and the Captain’s reputation without direct confrontation.

Red herrings included Clara Finch’s outspoken opposition (but she was home marking essays, and her language was never so formal), Blunt’s gossip (but he was at the pub, corroborated by others), and Griggs’s unreliable sighting. The only person with both motive, means, and opportunity was the vicar himself, betrayed by his own words and the convenience of his location.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong characterisation and a clear sense of place. The puzzle is structured around a classic closed-circle scenario, with a limited suspect pool and a focus on alibis and motive. The addition of detective notes deepens immersion and provides a neutral summary of facts and suspects, preserving the puzzle element.

The solution is logical and fair: the clues—Pym’s access to the private path, the formal language, and his ink-stained hands—are all present in the narrative and can be deduced by an attentive reader. The motivations are plausible and in keeping with the period’s social mores. Red herrings are well deployed, particularly Clara Finch’s opposition and Blunt’s pub alibi, which add complexity without misleading unfairly.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The narrative is tight, period-appropriate, and avoids anachronism. The open-ended question at the end invites the reader to solve the puzzle without leading them to the answer. The only minor critique is that the clue of the ink-stained hands could be more subtly integrated, but it does not spoil the puzzle.

Difficulty: 7/10. The puzzle requires careful attention to language and timeline, offering a satisfying challenge for readers familiar with the genre.
