## Narrative

The orchard behind the old vicarage had not seen a visitor in years, save for the occasional fox or the braver sort of child. On this particular April morning, Arthur Pym, local farmer and habitual early riser, stumbled upon the body of Mr. Lionel Hargreaves. The retired schoolmaster lay beneath a gnarled apple tree, a pamphlet bearing the emblem of the British Union of Fascists pinned to his coat with a brass drawing pin. The pamphlet fluttered in the breeze, as if the orchard itself were trying to rid itself of the ugly message.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived with his usual lack of ceremony, notebook in hand, eyes narrowed against the weak Sussex sun. PC Griggs hovered nearby, more hindrance than help. The orchard was cordoned off with baler twine, and the village’s curiosity was kept at bay by Mrs. Edith Hargreaves’s formidable glare. She stood at the vicarage gate, black-gloved hands folded, her expression unreadable.

Hesslewick began with Arthur Pym, who recounted his discovery with the air of a man who’d rather be mucking out pigs. “Saw something odd from the lane, sir. Thought it was a scarecrow at first. Then I saw the pamphlet. Nasty business, that.”

Mrs. Hargreaves, when pressed, admitted she and Lionel had been ‘living rather separate lives’ of late. “He was never home, Inspector. Always at the pub or off with his pamphlets. I told him it would bring trouble.” She dabbed at her eyes, though they remained dry.

Miss Clara Finch, the schoolteacher, arrived in a flurry of apologies. “I was at home marking essays all evening. Lionel and I—well, we’d disagreed about the school’s new curriculum. Nothing more.” She glanced at the pamphlet, her lips tightening. “He despised Mosley and his lot. This is a grotesque joke.”

Mr. George Snaith, publican of the Hare & Barrel, was summoned from his cellar. “Lionel was in last night, arguing with Arthur about the King. I told them both to take it outside. They left together, but Arthur came back in for his hat not five minutes later. Lionel didn’t.”

Hesslewick walked the orchard, noting the trampled grass and the faint scent of pipe tobacco. He found a muddy footprint near the gate, smaller than Arthur’s boots. He asked Mrs. Hargreaves if Lionel had any enemies. “Only those who dislike the truth, Inspector.”

As the day wore on, Hesslewick spoke again with Miss Finch. She mentioned seeing Edith Hargreaves in the lane late the previous evening, “walking quickly, as if she didn’t want to be seen.” Edith denied it, insisting she’d been at home all night, reading. “Ask Griggs,” she said. “He saw my light on when he passed.”

Arthur Pym, when questioned about the pamphlet, shrugged. “Never seen one before. Wouldn’t have one in my house.” Yet Hesslewick recalled Arthur’s son had been fined for distributing similar pamphlets in Brighton the previous year.

As dusk fell, Hesslewick gathered the villagers in the vicarage parlour. He recited the timeline: Lionel left the pub at 10:15, Arthur returned at 10:20, Clara was home by 9:30, Edith claims to have been reading until midnight. The orchard, overgrown and isolated, would have been pitch dark by then.

Hesslewick paused, eyes lingering on each face. “Someone here knows more than they’ve said. The pamphlet is a message, but not the one it appears to be.”

He closed his notebook. “One thing does not fit. One story cannot be true. Who placed Lionel Hargreaves in the orchard, and why?”

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick deduced that Mrs. Edith Hargreaves was the murderer. The crucial clue was the alibi she offered: she claimed to have been at home reading all night, and that PC Griggs saw her light on when he passed. However, the orchard is visible from the vicarage’s upstairs window, and the only way to reach it without being seen from the lane is via the garden gate at the back of the vicarage. Edith could have left a light burning in the front room to create the impression she was home, then slipped out the back unseen. 

The pamphlet was a red herring, intended to suggest a political motive and implicate Arthur Pym or another political adversary. However, Edith’s knowledge that Griggs saw her light on—something she could only know if she’d been watching for him—betrayed her. She had the opportunity, the means (a heavy brass candlestick was missing from the vicarage), and the motive: resentment over Lionel’s political activities and their estrangement. The muddy footprint near the gate matched her shoes, not Arthur’s boots. 

Hesslewick reasoned backward: only someone intimately familiar with the vicarage and its sightlines could have orchestrated the scene and the alibi. Edith’s story was the only one that did not fit the physical realities of the setting, revealing her guilt.

## Analysis

Review of Narrative:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting, with strong period detail and a cast of plausible suspects. The prose is tight and evocative, and the dialogue is consistent with the era and the characters’ social roles. The puzzle is preserved throughout, with no overt clues or leading questions that would spoil the solution. The detective’s notes are structured, immersive, and do not tip the reader toward the answer.

The suspects are presented neutrally, with their roles and relationships clearly delineated. The timeline is logical and the physical setting is described with enough specificity to allow the reader to reason through the possibilities. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider motive, opportunity, and the meaning of the pamphlet without steering them toward the solution.

Review of Solution:

The solution is logical and satisfying, relying on a subtle contradiction in Edith’s alibi and the physical realities of the vicarage and orchard. The use of the pamphlet as a red herring is effective, and the reasoning about the sightlines and the light left on is plausible for the period. The motive is credible, and the means are established through the missing candlestick and the footprint evidence. The solution is not trivial, but it is fair and can be deduced from the narrative with careful reading.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires attention to detail and inference, but does not hinge on obscure knowledge or arbitrary twists. It is challenging but fair, and should be satisfying for readers who enjoy classic village mysteries.
