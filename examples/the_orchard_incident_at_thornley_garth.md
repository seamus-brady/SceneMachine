## Narrative

Evening had settled over Thornley Garth with a damp chill that seeped into the bones. The old orchard, surrendered to nettles and bramble, stood at the village’s edge—a place for children’s dares and, on this night, the scene of a fatality.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived as the last of the sun’s light faded. PC Griggs, lantern in hand, waited beside the disused apple press. There, sprawled on the mossy earth, lay Samuel Lockett, his head at an unnatural angle, a length of iron piping discarded nearby. Mrs. Edith Mayhew, the postmistress, stood apart, her gloved hands trembling. Arthur Pelling, the farmhand, hovered protectively, his boots caked with orchard mud.

Hesslewick surveyed the scene with detachment. The orchard was a closed world: the only way in or out was the narrow path from the village, and the only witnesses were those present. Villagers, drawn by shouting, kept their distance, peering from behind hedges.

He began with Mrs. Mayhew, who recounted her version in clipped tones. She had been returning from the evening post collection when Lockett, whom she barely knew, accosted her by the apple press. He was agitated, demanding something she could not understand. She called for help, and Arthur Pelling arrived, wrestling with Lockett. In the struggle, Lockett fell. She insisted she never touched the iron pipe.

Arthur Pelling, broad-shouldered and earnest, claimed he heard Mrs. Mayhew’s cries from the lane. He ran to her aid, saw Lockett threatening her, and intervened. He admitted to striking Lockett with the pipe, but only after Lockett lunged at him. He repeated that he ‘had no choice.’

PC Griggs, methodical as ever, described arriving moments after the altercation. He found Mrs. Mayhew shaken, Pelling standing over Lockett, and the pipe lying nearby. He noted Mrs. Mayhew’s gloves were spotless, and Pelling’s shirt was torn at the shoulder. Griggs had heard shouting from the road, but by the time he reached the orchard, all was quiet but for Mrs. Mayhew’s sobs.

Hesslewick walked the orchard’s edge, noting trampled grass, muddy footprints, and the faint scent of apples gone sour. He questioned each in turn, his tone mild, his gaze unblinking. Pelling insisted he arrived just in time. Mrs. Mayhew maintained she was the victim. Griggs seemed content with the story as told.

Yet something did not fit. The pipe was heavy, awkward to wield in haste. The orchard mud clung to Pelling’s boots, but not to Mrs. Mayhew’s. Lockett’s cap, found some yards from his body, bore a smear of blood inconsistent with a single blow. Hesslewick made notes, asked about timing, shouts, the sequence of events. He listened for what was not said.

As the evening deepened, Hesslewick gathered the three by the apple press. He recited their accounts quietly, almost conversationally. Then he paused, looking from one to the next, and asked a single question about the position of the cap—a detail none had mentioned, but which, he suggested, might explain everything.

What has Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key to the puzzle lies in the position and condition of Samuel Lockett’s cap. According to the accounts, the altercation was sudden: Mrs. Mayhew was threatened, Pelling intervened, and Lockett was struck with the iron pipe. However, Lockett’s cap was found several yards from his body, bearing a smear of blood inconsistent with a single blow to the head. If the blow that killed Lockett was delivered during the struggle, his cap would likely have remained on or near his head, not flung so far away.

Moreover, the cap’s bloodstain suggests it was struck separately from the fatal blow. This indicates that Lockett was first struck on the head—hard enough to draw blood—while still standing, and only later received the fatal blow that felled him. The cap’s distance from the body implies it was knocked off before the final struggle.

Given Mrs. Mayhew’s spotless gloves and Pelling’s muddy boots, it seems unlikely Mrs. Mayhew wielded the pipe herself. However, the timeline is crucial: Mrs. Mayhew was returning from the post, Lockett accosted her, and she called for help. But the only way Pelling could have arrived so quickly is if he was already in the orchard, not on the lane as he claimed. His torn shirt and muddied boots suggest a longer struggle than he admitted.

The contradiction is this: Pelling’s account of arriving just in time is impossible. He was already present, likely confronting Lockett for reasons unspoken—perhaps a prior quarrel or suspicion. Mrs. Mayhew’s cries brought Griggs and the villagers, but by then the fatal blow had been struck. Pelling’s intervention was not to protect Mrs. Mayhew, but to cover his own involvement in a confrontation that turned deadly. The cap’s position and the sequence of blows reveal the truth: Pelling struck Lockett twice, the first time before Mrs. Mayhew arrived, the second time fatally during the supposed rescue.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric, consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, and tightly written. The characters are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the scene is described with enough detail to immerse the reader without overwhelming them. The dialogue and witness statements are plausible for the period and setting. The narrative avoids modern idioms and maintains a tone appropriate to the era. The inclusion of the orchard’s isolation and the villagers’ reactions adds to the sense of a closed-circle mystery.

The detective’s notes are structured and in keeping with Hesslewick’s investigative style, summarizing the incident, suspects, and known facts without giving away the solution or tipping the reader toward any particular suspect. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and observed traits rather than editorializing.

The narrative is coherent, and the clues are presented naturally within the story. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider the significance of the cap’s position without leading them to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clue—the cap’s distance from the body and its bloodstain—requires careful attention, but is fairly presented. The reasoning about the timeline and the physical evidence (mud, gloves, torn shirt) is sound and fits the facts as described. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure; it rewards attentive reading and logical deduction.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors in the narrative or solution. The only minor suggestion would be to clarify the timeline slightly, but the ambiguity is intentional and serves the puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring careful reading and inference, but all necessary information is present in the narrative.
