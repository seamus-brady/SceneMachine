## Narrative

The rain had stopped just before dawn, leaving the churchyard at St. Agnes slick and glistening, the grass pressed flat by the weight of the night. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived as the first bell tolled, his boots sinking into the mud beside the grave of Matilda Hargreaves. The earth had been disturbed, clumsily, as if the culprit had been in a hurry or unused to manual labour. A broken lantern lay among the discarded funeral wreaths, its glass smeared with mud. PC Griggs, already present, poked at a set of footprints that trailed along the hawthorn hedge, muttering about the state of the world and the price of good boots.

The Hargreaves family gathered in the lee of the church wall, their faces drawn and pale. Edith Hargreaves, recently returned from London, stood apart, her gloved hands clenched around a black umbrella. Samuel Hargreaves, the orchard worker, scowled at the ground, his boots caked with the same mud that lined the grave. Vera Pym, the housekeeper, hovered anxiously, her apron still dusted with flour. Cecil Morton, the distant cousin from Brighton, dabbed at his brow with a monogrammed handkerchief, glancing nervously at the church door.

Hesslewick began his inquiries with Vera Pym, who insisted she had heard footsteps outside her cottage around midnight but had been too frightened to look. Edith claimed she had been reading in her room at the manor, unable to sleep. Samuel admitted to being near the churchyard late in the evening, tending to a sickly apple tree, but swore he had left before nightfall. Cecil, for his part, said he had retired early, exhausted from his journey, and had not left his room.

The inspector walked the perimeter, noting the muddy footprints, one set larger than the others, with a peculiar notch in the heel. He examined the broken lantern, its wick still faintly scented with paraffin. He asked Samuel about the orchard, and Samuel bristled, muttering about outsiders and inheritance. Edith, when pressed, grew defensive, insisting she had no interest in the orchard beyond what was rightfully hers. Cecil, cornered by Hesslewick’s quiet questions, admitted he was in financial difficulty but denied any knowledge of the documents.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick observed the interactions: Vera’s nervous glances at Edith, Samuel’s resentment simmering just below the surface, Cecil’s eagerness to be helpful without ever quite answering a question directly. The inspector returned to the grave, studying the disturbed earth, the footprints, the lantern, and the hedge. He asked Vera about the funeral arrangements, and she mentioned that the lantern had gone missing from the kitchen the night before. Edith, overhearing, remarked that she had seen Samuel near the house after dark, though Samuel denied it.

Hesslewick paused, notebook in hand, as the church bell struck noon. He looked once more at the muddy prints, the broken lantern, and the anxious faces of the Hargreaves family. Something did not fit, a detail out of place, a story that contradicted itself. He closed his notebook with a snap.

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key clue lies in the muddy footprints and the broken lantern. Samuel claims to have left the churchyard before nightfall, tending to the orchard, and denies being near the house after dark. However, Vera’s lantern went missing from the kitchen the night before, and Edith claims to have seen Samuel near the house after dark. The footprints by the grave match Samuel’s boots, which are caked with the same mud as the grave site. The peculiar notch in the heel is distinctive and matches Samuel’s boots exactly.

The contradiction is that Samuel could not have both left before nightfall and been seen near the house after dark. Furthermore, only someone familiar with the house would know where the lantern was kept. Samuel’s resentment about outsiders and inheritance, combined with his opportunity and the physical evidence of the footprints and lantern, point to his guilt. He disturbed the grave to retrieve the documents, hoping to secure his claim to the orchard. The red herrings—Vera’s nervousness, Cecil’s financial troubles, and Edith’s strained relationship with her mother—distract from the physical impossibility of Samuel’s alibi. Hesslewick realizes that Samuel’s story does not fit the timeline or the evidence, revealing him as the culprit.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting, with strong period detail and a clear sense of place. The cast of suspects is distinct, each with plausible motives and personalities. The puzzle is presented fairly, with clues embedded in dialogue and observation rather than overt exposition. The detective’s method is consistent with his established character, and the story maintains a neutral, immersive tone throughout.

The narrative is tight, with little extraneous detail. The suspects’ statements and interactions are believable and avoid anachronism. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider the contradictions without steering them toward the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Samuel’s alibi, the physical evidence of the footprints and the lantern, and the knowledge of the lantern’s location all point to him as the culprit. The red herrings are effective but not misleading. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable, striking a good balance of difficulty.

There are no significant inconsistencies or errors. The only minor note is that the distinctive notch in Samuel’s boot could be more subtly introduced, but it does not undermine the puzzle’s fairness.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

This puzzle requires careful attention to alibis, physical evidence, and character motivations, making it moderately challenging for readers familiar with the genre.
