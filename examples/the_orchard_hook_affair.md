## Narrative

It was the sort of evening that made the orchard seem older than its years: a low, bruised sky, the scent of rain on chalk, and the last birdsong already fading. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the edge of Thornley Garth’s disused smithy, his boots sinking into the soft ground where the orchard grass gave way to nettles. PC Griggs, red-faced and wheezing, stood guard over a bloodied pruning hook and a broken scythe, both lying in the trampled grass.

Arthur Pelling, the farmhand, lay unconscious on a makeshift stretcher, his head swaddled in Mrs. Fallow’s best linen. Lark, the seasonal labourer, sat on a crate, hands shaking, eyes fixed on the ground. Mrs. Fallow hovered nearby, her umbrella clutched like a sceptre, while Harold Bexley, the orchard’s owner, paced the perimeter, muttering about ruined harvests and the price of steel.

Hesslewick surveyed the scene, notebook in hand. He asked Griggs to recount the sequence: Mrs. Fallow, returning from Evensong, had seen Lark dragging Pelling’s limp form from behind the smithy. She’d shouted, drawing Bexley and several villagers. Lark claimed Pelling’s injury was a ghastly accident—he’d found him already hurt, panicked at the sight of blood, and tried to help. The broken scythe, he said, was the result of their earlier quarrel over carelessness.

Bexley confirmed the quarrel but insisted he’d left both men working in the orchard at dusk. He’d been in his cottage, he said, tallying accounts. Mrs. Fallow, sharp-eyed as ever, insisted she’d glimpsed a third figure near the smithy before the commotion, though she couldn’t say who. Griggs had been patrolling the lane and only arrived after the alarm was raised.

Hesslewick began his interviews. Lark’s story was halting: he’d argued with Pelling over the broken scythe, stalked off to cool his temper, and returned to find Pelling collapsed. He’d seen the blood, panicked, and tried to drag him to help. He denied touching the pruning hook. His hands bore fresh scratches.

Mrs. Fallow described seeing Lark dragging Pelling, but added that she’d heard voices—three, not two—earlier by the smithy. She’d glimpsed a cap she didn’t recognise. Bexley, when pressed, scoffed: ‘No one skulking about my orchard but my men and the odd rabbit.’

Hesslewick walked the ground. The pruning hook lay where the grass was flattened, but the broken scythe was several yards away, near the smithy wall. A set of muddy footprints led from the orchard to the smithy, then doubled back. He noted a torn scrap of cloth snagged on a bramble—dark, not matching Pelling’s or Lark’s jackets.

As dusk deepened, Hesslewick gathered the group. He recounted their stories, quietly, methodically. Then he paused, eyes lingering on Bexley’s boots, Mrs. Fallow’s umbrella, Lark’s trembling hands. ‘Curious,’ he said, ‘how stories shift with the light.’

He closed his notebook. ‘One thing troubles me. But perhaps someone here can explain it—before the constable does.’

Why does Hesslewick doubt the story of the accident? What detail in the orchard does not fit?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the location of the broken scythe and the muddy footprints. Lark claims the injury was accidental and that he found Pelling already hurt, then tried to help. However, the broken scythe is found near the smithy wall, several yards from the bloodied pruning hook and the main scene of the struggle. If the quarrel and accident had occurred where Pelling was found, the scythe should be nearby. The footprints show someone walked from the orchard to the smithy and back, suggesting movement after the incident.

The telling clue is the torn scrap of dark cloth on the bramble, which does not match Lark’s or Pelling’s clothing. This suggests a third person was present—likely Bexley, who wears a dark jacket and had motive to intervene in the quarrel over his damaged equipment. Mrs. Fallow’s memory of a third voice and an unfamiliar cap supports this. Bexley’s insistence that only his men were present is suspicious, and his muddy boots match the pattern of footprints.

Hesslewick realises that Bexley, frustrated by the ongoing quarrel and damage, confronted the men, leading to a struggle in which Pelling was struck with the pruning hook. Bexley then attempted to stage the scene as an accident, moving the scythe and leaving in haste, snagging his jacket. Lark’s panic and confusion are genuine—he stumbled onto the aftermath, not the crime itself.

Thus, the contradiction in the placement of the scythe and the physical evidence of a third party reveal Bexley’s involvement.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and immersive, capturing the rural English setting of 1937 with convincing detail. The characters are distinct, and the dialogue is consistent with the period. The puzzle is well-constructed, presenting multiple plausible suspects and motives without overtly guiding the reader to the solution. The detective’s notes are structured, in-world, and deepen immersion without giving away the answer.

The clues are fairly distributed: the placement of the scythe, the muddy footprints, the torn cloth, and Mrs. Fallow’s observations all point to a third party’s involvement. The narrative avoids modernisms and maintains coherence with the time and place. The questions at the end are open-ended and do not lead the reader to the solution.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in the placement of the scythe and the evidence of a third party (the torn cloth and Mrs. Fallow’s testimony) are subtle but fair clues. The reasoning is sound, and the solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure. The puzzle’s difficulty is moderate, requiring careful attention to physical evidence and witness statements.

Difficulty: 6/10

No inconsistencies or major errors were found. The puzzle is satisfying and solvable, with a well-balanced level of challenge.
