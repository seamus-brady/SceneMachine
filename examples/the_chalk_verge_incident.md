## Narrative

Scene 1: Dusk at the Fox & Hounds

The Fox & Hounds pub sits at the edge of Thornley Garth, its windows glowing against the dusk. Outside, the chalk verge is uneven, worn by years of boots and sheep. A crowd has gathered, voices low and urgent. At the centre lies William 'Billy' Harker, his head at an unnatural angle, a smear of blood bright against the white stone. George Tilley stands nearby, face pale, knuckles raw. PC Griggs, sweating in his uniform, keeps a hand on Tilley’s shoulder. Mrs. Edith Lacey, the publican’s wife, wrings her apron, eyes darting between the men. Tommy Lacey, her son, leans against the pub wall, arms folded, jaw set.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrives, notebook in hand, Bixby at his heel. He surveys the scene, noting the scuffed earth, the scattered pint glass, and the hush that falls as he approaches.

Scene 2: The Investigation Begins

Hesslewick moves quietly, asking for accounts. Mrs. Lacey speaks first: “Billy and George were shouting about money—poaching, too, if you ask me. Billy lunged, George swung, and Billy went down. I ran for Griggs.”

Tilley, voice trembling: “He called me a thief. I told him to mind himself. He came at me, I pushed him—just the once. He slipped, that’s all. I never meant—”

Tommy Lacey, eyes narrowed: “Billy was spoiling for it. Always is. He’d had a few, started on George, then tripped over his own feet. Nothing more to it.”

PC Griggs, methodical: “Arrived at 8:12. Found Harker as you see him. Tilley admitted to striking him. No weapon, no sign of anything else.”

Scene 3: Hesslewick Interviews the Witnesses

Hesslewick walks the verge, noting the deep rut where Harker fell. He questions Mrs. Lacey about the sequence. She insists she saw the blow, then the fall. “He hit the back of his head, poor lad. I tried to help, but there was nothing to be done.”

Tommy, when pressed, shrugs: “Billy’s always after trouble. He’d have come to grief sooner or later.”

Tilley, in custody, mutters: “He was shouting about the snares. Said I’d grassed him up. I just wanted him to leave me be.”

Scene 4: The Detective Observes

Hesslewick notes the position of the body, the angle of the head, the blood pooling on the higher side of the rut. He asks Mrs. Lacey if anyone else touched the body. She hesitates, then says she tried to move him, but only after he was clearly gone.

He asks Tommy where he was standing. “By the door, same as always. Saw the whole thing.”

Hesslewick glances at Tommy’s boots—chalk dust caked thickly, as if he’d been on the verge, not the step. He asks about the pint glass. Mrs. Lacey says it was Billy’s, dropped when he fell. Yet the glass is unbroken, upright, a yard from the scuffle.

Scene 5: The Puzzle Tightens

Hesslewick sketches the scene in his notebook. He asks Griggs if anyone left the area before he arrived. Griggs shakes his head. “All present and accounted for.”

He asks Mrs. Lacey about the poaching talk. She glances at Tommy, then away. “Billy and Tommy never got on. Always after the same patch, weren’t they?”

Hesslewick lingers by the verge, considering the angle of the fall, the position of the glass, the dust on Tommy’s boots. He asks Tommy again where he was standing. Tommy repeats, “By the door.”

Hesslewick closes his notebook. “Thank you, everyone. That will be all for now.”

Why does Inspector Hesslewick doubt Tommy’s account? What detail does not fit?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in Tommy Lacey’s claim that he was standing by the pub door throughout the altercation. However, Hesslewick observes that Tommy’s boots are thickly caked with fresh chalk dust, which would only be acquired by standing or moving on the uneven chalk verge where Harker fell. If Tommy had remained on the pub step, his boots would be relatively clean, as the step is stone, not chalk.

Additionally, the pint glass, said to have been dropped by Harker as he fell, is found upright and unbroken a yard from the scuffle. This suggests it was placed there after the fact, not dropped in the heat of a violent fall. Only someone who approached the body after the incident could have set it down so neatly.

The contradiction in Tommy’s account—his boots and the glass—suggests he was on the verge, not by the door, and interacted with the scene after Harker fell. This, combined with the rivalry over poaching territory and Mrs. Lacey’s nervous glance, points to Tommy’s involvement. He likely confronted Harker after the initial blow, perhaps in anger or panic, and either moved the glass or even contributed to Harker’s fatal injury during the confusion. His attempt to distance himself from the scene is what gives him away.

Inspector Hesslewick deduces that Tommy’s story does not fit the physical evidence, and that he is concealing his true actions during the crucial moments of Harker’s death.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are well-drawn, and the dialogue is period-appropriate. The structure is tight, with each scene advancing the investigation logically. The inclusion of subtle physical details (chalk dust, pint glass, blood pooling) provides the reader with fair clues without overtly signaling the solution. The suspects are presented neutrally, and the witness statements are plausible and in character. The narrative avoids modern idioms and maintains immersion in the era.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that deepens immersion and preserves the puzzle. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and relationships rather than hinting at guilt. The known facts section is factual and avoids editorializing.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction between Tommy’s account and the physical evidence (chalk dust, pint glass) is subtle but fair. The reasoning is sound, and the clues are present but not heavy-handed. The motive (rivalry over poaching) is plausible and fits the setting. The solution avoids triviality and is neither too obvious nor too obscure.

Difficulty Assessment:

On a scale of 1 to 10, the puzzle rates as a 6. The clues are present and fair, but require careful attention to physical detail and character statements. The solution is satisfying for readers who enjoy piecing together subtle inconsistencies.

Overall, the puzzle is well-constructed, immersive, and fair. No major inconsistencies or errors are present. The narrative and solution are coherent, and the puzzle offers a satisfying challenge without being either trivial or unsolvable.
