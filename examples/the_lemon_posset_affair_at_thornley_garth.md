## Narrative

The vicarage drawing room at Thornley Garth was, on the evening in question, a study in genteel chaos. The apple-blossom season had ended, and the Reverend Samuel Pritchard, whose finances were as delicate as his teacups, had opened his home to a select few. The air was thick with the scent of lemon, beeswax, and the faintest whiff of rivalry.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived after the fact, summoned by a note pressed into his hand by PC Griggs, who looked as if he’d rather be mucking out pigs. Mrs. Edith Lavington, the squire’s wife, had collapsed at the tea table, her face gone the colour of old parchment. The cause: arsenic, discovered in the dregs of her lemon posset. Only Mrs. Lavington had fallen ill, though the posset had been served to all.

The cast was small, the setting smaller. Hesslewick found them gathered in the drawing room, each arranged as if for a portrait: Miss Clara Finch, stiff as a poker and twice as sharp; Reverend Pritchard, hands folded, eyes darting to the silver tray; Mrs. Tilley, the housemaid, wringing her apron; and Mr. Harold Lavington, the bereaved, whose composure was so complete it bordered on impolite.

The detective began with the kitchen. Mrs. Tilley insisted she had prepared the tea things herself, save for the posset, which she claimed to have left cooling on the sideboard. She had seen Miss Finch near the kitchen just before tea was served. Miss Finch, for her part, admitted to fetching a book from the hallway but denied entering the kitchen. She had, she said, no taste for desserts, nor for Mrs. Lavington’s company. The vicar, meanwhile, confessed to having been in his study, wrestling with his sermon and his creditors. Mr. Lavington claimed to have been in the garden, pruning roses, a pastime his wife had always found frivolous.

Hesslewick moved through the interviews with the patience of a man untangling fishing line. He noted the vicar’s nervous glances at the empty decanter, Miss Finch’s clipped answers, and Mrs. Tilley’s insistence that she had seen what she had seen. Mr. Lavington, when pressed, remarked that his wife had always preferred lemon to apple, and that the posset was her own request.

A few details emerged: the kitchen window had been open, though the evening was cool. A half-used packet of rat poison sat on a high shelf, its paper torn. Mrs. Tilley said it had been there for weeks, untouched. Miss Finch’s gloves were found on the hall table, faintly dusted with flour. The vicar’s sermon notes bore a ring of lemon curd. Mr. Lavington’s shoes were muddy, though the garden paths were dry.

As the evening wore on, Hesslewick sat in the drawing room, notebook in hand, while the grandfather clock ticked with the slow certainty of accusation. He asked, almost idly, who had poured the posset. Mrs. Tilley replied that she had, as always. Miss Finch looked away. The vicar coughed. Mr. Lavington smiled, thinly.

The guests departed, one by one, under the watchful eye of PC Griggs. Hesslewick lingered, staring at the empty dessert bowls, the pattern of crumbs, the faint scent of lemon lingering in the air. Something, he felt, did not fit. The answer, he suspected, was as simple and as sharp as the taste of arsenic in a silver spoon.

What, in the end, has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s deduction hinges on a subtle but telling inconsistency: Mr. Lavington’s shoes were muddy, though the garden paths were dry. This suggests he was not, as he claimed, pruning roses in the garden at the time the posset was left unattended. Instead, he must have been elsewhere—most likely in the kitchen, where the only source of mud was a potted plant by the back door, recently watered and with soil disturbed.

Further, Mr. Lavington’s calm demeanor and his remark about his wife’s preference for lemon suggest foreknowledge of the method. The rat poison, kept on a high shelf, would be accessible to someone tall like Mr. Lavington, but not easily to Mrs. Tilley or Miss Finch. The gloves dusted with flour (Miss Finch) and the vicar’s lemon curd-stained notes are red herrings—neither had opportunity or motive as strong as the squire, who stood to inherit and whose marriage was known to be strained.

The key clue is the environmental mismatch: the mud on Mr. Lavington’s shoes contradicts his alibi. Hesslewick reasons that Mr. Lavington slipped into the kitchen while the posset cooled, added the arsenic, and returned to the drawing room, unnoticed. The poison was thus administered not by the obvious suspects, but by the one whose story did not fit the physical evidence.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and tightly constructed, with a strong sense of place and character. The setting and period details are consistent with 1937 rural England, and the cast of suspects is well-drawn, each with plausible roles and personalities. The dialogue and descriptions avoid anachronism and maintain immersion. The detective’s methodical approach is well-portrayed, and the inclusion of small, seemingly innocuous details (muddy shoes, flour-dusted gloves, lemon curd stains) provides a fair playing field for the reader.

The detective’s notes are structured, in-world, and avoid giving away the solution, instead summarizing the key facts and suspects in a neutral tone. The suspect list is clean, focusing on roles and personalities rather than editorial hints.

The narrative is concise, with little extraneous detail. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle for the reader.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and well-supported by the narrative. The key clue—the mud on Mr. Lavington’s shoes—provides a fair and solvable puzzle, as it directly contradicts his stated alibi. The other details (flour, lemon curd) serve as effective red herrings without being misleading or unfair. The motive is plausible, and the opportunity is clearly established. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

The puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring careful attention to environmental details and character statements. It is solvable by a reader who pays close attention, but not so difficult as to be frustrating. All necessary clues are present in the narrative.

No major inconsistencies or errors were found. The puzzle is fair, immersive, and satisfying.
