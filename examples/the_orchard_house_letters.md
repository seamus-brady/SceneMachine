## Narrative

Orchard House, with its sagging eaves and overgrown apple trees, had always been a place of quiet authority in Thornley Garth. On a damp Thursday in May, that quiet was broken by the arrival of Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned by Mrs. Elspeth Hargreaves herself. The matter, she insisted, was delicate: someone had been sending anonymous blackmail letters to several villagers, including herself, Mr. Lionel Preece the grocer, and—though he would never admit it—Reverend Simon Bell. The letters were typed, signed 'A Friend of Thornley Garth,' and contained details only an insider could know. The most recent demanded Mrs. Hargreaves withdraw her support for the new parish hall. A discarded typewriter ribbon had been found near the green, but no one had seen the letters delivered.

Hesslewick arrived just as the village was gathering for the monthly parish tea, held in the drawing room of Orchard House. The suspects were all present: Mrs. Hargreaves, dignified but visibly strained; Mr. Preece, nervously stirring his tea; Miss Ivy Cartwright, the parish council secretary, prim and watchful; Reverend Bell, hands folded, eyes downcast; and Mr. Arthur Finch, retired schoolmaster, who seemed to be everywhere and nowhere at once. PC Griggs hovered by the door, looking for all the world like he’d rather be pruning roses.

Hesslewick began quietly, observing the room. He noted the typewriter on the writing desk—Mrs. Hargreaves’s own, she said, though she claimed it had not left the house in months. Miss Cartwright, as secretary, had access to the council’s typewriter, but insisted it was locked in the vestry. Mr. Preece, when pressed, admitted he owned no typewriter at all. Reverend Bell smiled thinly and said he preferred pen and ink. Mr. Finch, when asked, replied that he had never mastered the machine, though he had once taught shorthand.

The conversation turned to the letters. Mrs. Hargreaves described hers: a demand to withdraw support for the parish hall, with a veiled threat about her late husband’s business dealings. Mr. Preece’s letter insisted he alter his shop’s credit policy, hinting at his financial troubles. Miss Cartwright claimed she had received no letter, but her eyes flickered when Hesslewick mentioned the parish records. Reverend Bell, after a pause, admitted to a letter urging him to intervene in village disputes—or else certain confessions might become public. Mr. Finch, for his part, said he had heard rumors but received nothing himself.

Hesslewick asked about the night the latest letter appeared. Mrs. Hargreaves said she had been at home, with only her housekeeper for company. Mr. Preece claimed he was closing up the shop. Miss Cartwright said she was preparing minutes for the council meeting. Reverend Bell was visiting a parishioner. Mr. Finch, when pressed, admitted to a late walk—he had trouble sleeping, he said, and sometimes found the night air helpful. PC Griggs confirmed seeing Finch near the postbox around midnight, but Finch insisted he was merely posting a birthday card to his niece.

As the tea cooled and the rain began to patter against the windows, Hesslewick wandered the room, pausing by the writing desk. He noted the typewriter’s ribbon was nearly new, though Mrs. Hargreaves insisted it had not been used in weeks. A faint smudge of ink stained the edge of the blotter. On the mantelpiece, a stack of parish council minutes, neatly typed, bore Miss Cartwright’s initials. Hesslewick asked if she had typed them at home or in the vestry. She hesitated, then said she sometimes took work home, but only ever used the vestry typewriter.

Mr. Preece, meanwhile, grew agitated when the conversation turned to debts. He insisted his books were in order, though everyone knew otherwise. Reverend Bell, calm as ever, offered tea to all, his hands steady. Mr. Finch, watching from the window, remarked on the peculiar weather—rain one moment, sun the next. Hesslewick asked if Finch had seen anyone near the green the night the ribbon was found. Finch shook his head, but mentioned seeing a light in the vestry after midnight.

The tea ended with polite farewells, but Hesslewick lingered, notebook in hand. He reviewed the facts: the letters, the typewriters, the alibis, the ribbon. Something did not fit—a detail out of place, a story that could not be true. He closed his notebook with a snap and thanked Mrs. Hargreaves for her hospitality.

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect Miss Cartwright? What detail in her account does not add up? What has the inspector realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key contradiction lies in Miss Cartwright’s account of her use of the parish council typewriter. She claims she only ever uses the vestry typewriter for council minutes, yet the latest batch of minutes—typed and initialed by her—was found on Mrs. Hargreaves’s mantelpiece, and the ink smudge on the writing desk matches the typewriter in Orchard House. Furthermore, she hesitated when asked where she typed the minutes, suggesting she sometimes took work home. However, Mrs. Hargreaves insists her typewriter had not been used in weeks, yet its ribbon is nearly new, and a fresh ink smudge is present. The discarded ribbon found near the green suggests someone changed it recently, likely to avoid detection by matching the typeface or ribbon wear to the blackmail letters. Miss Cartwright, with access to both typewriters and parish records, had the means and knowledge to compose the letters and the opportunity to use Mrs. Hargreaves’s typewriter when visiting for council business. Her motive—resentment over being overlooked and a desire for influence—fits the demands in the letters. The environmental mismatch and time inconsistency in her story reveal her guilt: she used Mrs. Hargreaves’s typewriter to type both the council minutes and the blackmail letters, then changed the ribbon to cover her tracks, discarding the old one near the green. Hesslewick deduced her involvement from the physical evidence and her contradictory statements.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting, capturing the social dynamics and tensions of a small village. The suspects are well-drawn, each with plausible motives and alibis, and the clues are embedded naturally in the dialogue and observations. The detective’s method is in keeping with Hesslewick’s established character—quiet, precise, and psychologically astute.

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative, relying on the contradiction in Miss Cartwright’s statements about the typewriter and the physical evidence of the ink smudge and new ribbon. The discarded ribbon is a subtle but fair clue, and the motive is believable within the context of village politics. The puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable, requiring careful attention to detail and character statements.

The open-ended questions at the end of the narrative are appropriate, inviting the reader to consider the inconsistencies without leading them directly to the answer. The narrative is tight, with no extraneous detail, and the period setting is maintained throughout. There are no significant inconsistencies or errors in logic. The difficulty level is moderate, as the clues are present but require synthesis and inference rather than simple deduction.
