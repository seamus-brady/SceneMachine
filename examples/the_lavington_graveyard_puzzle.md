## Narrative

Scene 1: The Churchyard at Dawn

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at St. Agnes’ churchyard as the mist lifted, revealing upturned earth beside Mrs. Edith Lavington’s grave. The spade and crowbar, both flecked with chalky soil, lay abandoned by the iron gate, which swung gently in the breeze. PC Griggs, red-faced and sweating, greeted him with a nod.

“Morning, sir. Found it like this at half six. Gate was open, tools from the shed. No footprints beyond the wall. Odd, that.”

Hesslewick surveyed the scene, hands clasped behind his back. The grave had been clumsily disturbed, the coffin prised open. The rumoured jewellery—family heirlooms, whispered to be hidden on Mrs. Lavington’s person—was gone.

Scene 2: The Suspects Assemble

By eight o’clock, the churchyard had attracted a small, uneasy congregation. Mr. Harold Lavington, the late Mrs. Lavington’s nephew, stood apart, coat collar up despite the mild air. Miss Clara Finch, the housekeeper, dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief, her gaze sharp. Reverend Pritchard hovered near the vestry door, wringing his hands. Mrs. Ivy Merton, orchard owner and neighbour, arrived last, breathless and bristling with indignation.

Hesslewick made his introductions, listening and noting.

Scene 3: Interviews

First, Harold Lavington. “I was at the Red Lion until closing,” he said, voice clipped. “Ask anyone. I came home, went straight to bed. I’ve no interest in the old trinkets. She left me nothing but a silver thimble.”

Miss Finch, still clutching her handkerchief, insisted she’d been at the Lavington house all night. “I checked the windows twice, Inspector. Not a soul about. I only heard about the grave this morning, from Griggs.”

Reverend Pritchard, pale and perspiring, claimed he’d been preparing his sermon late into the night. “I locked the church at ten, as always. The tools should have been in the shed. I can’t imagine—well, it’s sacrilege.”

Mrs. Merton, cheeks flushed, declared she’d been pruning her apple trees until dusk, then reading by the fire. “I heard nothing. If you ask me, it’s outsiders. No one here would stoop so low.”

Scene 4: The Investigation

Hesslewick paced the churchyard, noting the absence of footprints beyond the gate. The ground was soft from last night’s rain—anyone leaving would have left a trace. He examined the tools: both bore the church’s initials, but the spade’s handle was sticky with sap.

He visited the Lavington house. Miss Finch hovered anxiously. “I never saw her wear the brooch, Inspector. She said it was for safekeeping. I suppose it’s gone for good now.”

At the vicarage, Reverend Pritchard offered tea with trembling hands. “The repairs are costly, Inspector. But I’d never—well, it’s unthinkable.”

Mrs. Merton, when pressed, bristled. “If you’re suggesting I’d dig up a grave for a handful of baubles, you’re barking up the wrong tree. I have my pride, Inspector.”

Scene 5: The Puzzle Deepens

Hesslewick returned to the churchyard. He noted the sap on the spade—unusual for a tool kept in a stone shed. He walked the perimeter, observing the undisturbed grass beyond the gate. He paused by the orchard fence, where a branch had been freshly snapped.

He gathered the suspects once more. “The thief did not leave the churchyard,” he said quietly. “The question is, where did they go?”

He looked at each face in turn, then at the orchard beyond the fence.

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect one of the villagers? What detail does not fit with the others?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key clue is the sap on the spade handle. The church’s tools are kept in a stone shed and should not have fresh sap on them unless they were recently used in the orchard. Only Mrs. Ivy Merton, the orchard owner, had both the opportunity and reason to use a spade in her trees (she claimed to have been pruning until dusk). The snapped branch by the orchard fence suggests someone entered the orchard from the churchyard. Since the ground was soft and there were no footprints beyond the gate, the thief must have left by another route—over the fence into the orchard, not through the gate. Mrs. Merton’s alibi is weak; she was alone, and her financial troubles gave her motive. The red herrings include Harold’s resentment, Miss Finch’s missing brooch, and Reverend Pritchard’s need for funds. Hesslewick deduced that Mrs. Merton used her orchard work as cover, took the jewellery, and left the tools by the gate to suggest an outsider. The contradiction—sap on the spade, snapped branch, and undisturbed gate path—reveals her guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and consistent with the 1937 rural English village setting. The language and characterisation are appropriate for the period, and the structure is clear, moving from discovery to interviews and investigation. The suspects are well-drawn, each with plausible motives and alibis, and the red herrings are effective without being heavy-handed. The inclusion of physical clues (sap, snapped branch, undisturbed ground) is subtle and does not tip the reader off prematurely. The dialogue is concise and in keeping with the time and place.

The detective’s notes are integrated in a way that deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle. The suspect list is neutral, focusing on roles and relationships rather than hinting at guilt.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key clues (sap on the spade, snapped branch, lack of footprints) are all present and fair, and the reasoning is sound. The puzzle is not trivial, as it requires the reader to connect multiple details and consider alternative explanations. The red herrings are plausible and do not distract from the central logic. The solution is neither silly nor overly obvious, and the narrative provides enough information for a careful reader to solve the puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring attention to detail and inference, but it is solvable with close reading. The clues are fair, and the misdirection is effective without being misleading. Overall, it is a strong example of a classic cosy crime puzzle.
