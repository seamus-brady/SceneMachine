## Narrative

The parlour of Mrs. Edith Lavington’s house, Thornley Garth, was a study in rural respectability: faded chintz, the scent of apples, and, on the evening of May 4th, 1937, a shattered lamp and a faint whiff of cordite. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived just as the last of the dusk slipped behind the orchard. PC Griggs, red-faced and apologetic, hovered by the door, muttering about city men and Sussex soil.

Mrs. Lavington lay slumped in her armchair, her teacup toppled, the dregs staining the rug. The revolver—her late husband’s, according to Miss Draycott—rested on the hearth, one chamber empty. The lamp, once a wedding gift, was now a constellation of glass beneath the window. Hesslewick noted the details, his gaze lingering on the tea service: two cups, one untouched, one drained.

Miss Clara Draycott, the housekeeper, stood rigid by the mantel. “I heard raised voices, sir. Mrs. Lavington and Mr. Finch—her nephew—were quarrelling. He’s been nothing but trouble since he returned from London. I was in the kitchen, preparing the supper tray. When I heard the crash, I ran in. Arthur was gone. Mrs. Lavington—she was gasping. I saw the tea, smelled something odd. I fetched Dr. Prowse.”

Mr. Lionel Prowse, neighbour and local orchard-keeper, arrived moments later, summoned by Miss Draycott’s frantic knock. “I saw young Finch arrive just after seven. He looked agitated. I was pruning the east hedge. Later, I saw him leave at a run, nearly knocked me over. I came in, found Clara with Edith. The revolver was there, but I never heard a shot.”

Arthur Finch, the missing nephew, was the subject of much speculation. Estranged from Mrs. Lavington over a disputed inheritance, he had returned from London under a cloud. No one had seen him since the incident. Miss Draycott insisted Mrs. Lavington had received threatening letters—anonymous, clipped from newspapers. “She showed me one last week. Said she feared for her life. Arthur always denied it, but who else would wish her harm?”

Hesslewick moved through the house with his usual, silent precision. The kitchen was spotless, save for a faint trace of apple peel in the sink. The larder was locked. In the parlour, he examined the tea things: the untouched cup bore a faint lipstick mark—Miss Draycott’s shade, he surmised. The sugar bowl was nearly empty, the spoon sticky. The revolver, old but functional, had been fired once. The bullet was lodged in the skirting board, far from where Mrs. Lavington had fallen.

He questioned Miss Draycott again. “You say you were in the kitchen the whole time?”
She nodded, hands twisting her apron. “Yes, sir. I only came when I heard the crash.”
“And the tea?”
“I brewed it just before. Mrs. Lavington liked it strong. I took her cup in, left mine on the tray. I never touched it.”

Mr. Prowse, summoned again, was less forthcoming. “I saw Arthur arrive, yes. He was carrying a parcel. Didn’t see what became of it. I was outside the whole time, except when Clara fetched me.”

The evening drew in. Hesslewick, notebook in hand, reviewed the facts. No sign of forced entry. Two cups, one drunk, one not. A revolver fired, but not at the victim. A shattered lamp, a missing nephew, and a housekeeper who seemed to know more than she said.

He gathered the household in the parlour, the air thick with accusation and the scent of apples. “Someone in this room knows what happened to Mrs. Lavington,” he said quietly. “And it is not, I think, the person everyone suspects.”

Why does Inspector Hesslewick doubt the obvious? What detail in the parlour does not fit the stories told?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s suspicion falls on Miss Clara Draycott, not Arthur Finch. The telling clue is the lipstick mark on the untouched teacup. Miss Draycott claimed she never touched her tea, yet her lipstick is on the rim. This means she was in the parlour before the struggle, not in the kitchen as she claimed. She brewed two cups, poisoned Mrs. Lavington’s, and left her own as a decoy. When the confrontation with Arthur turned violent, the lamp was knocked over and the revolver discharged in the confusion. Arthur fled, panicked, but was not the poisoner. Miss Draycott’s motive: loyalty twisted into resentment after years of service and being overlooked in the will. The lipstick mark, a small but damning inconsistency, reveals her presence and her guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 rural English setting. The details—faded chintz, apple scent, and the interplay of village personalities—are evocative and consistent with the period. The dialogue is natural, and the characters’ roles and relationships are clearly established. The puzzle is preserved, with the clues embedded in the narrative rather than highlighted or editorialized. The suspects are presented neutrally, and the questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to engage with the mystery.

The detective’s notes are structured, in-world, and avoid giving away the solution. They summarize the key facts and suspects without editorializing or leading the reader.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and fair. The lipstick mark on the untouched cup is a subtle but clear contradiction in Miss Draycott’s account, and it is possible for an attentive reader to deduce her guilt. The motive is plausible and fits the social dynamics of the time. The actions of the other suspects are accounted for, and the narrative does not rely on coincidence or triviality. The puzzle is neither too easy nor unsolvable, striking a good balance for a cosy crime mystery.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires careful reading and attention to detail, particularly regarding the teacup and the housekeeper’s movements. It is challenging but fair, and the clues are present without being overt.
