## Narrative

The morning mist still clung to the yew trees when Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at St. Olave’s churchyard. The iron gate hung askew, its lock twisted by brute force. Beyond, a patch of raw earth marked the grave of Captain Lionel Fawkes, disturbed in the night, the coffin prised open, and the late officer’s regimental badge and other effects spirited away. A note, pinned to the church door with a bent nail, accused the dead man of betrayal in a hand that aspired to anonymity but achieved only clumsy menace.

Hesslewick, notebook in hand, surveyed the scene. Muddy footprints led from the gate to the grave, then vanished into the grass. The villagers, gathered in uneasy knots, offered little: no one had seen or heard a thing. The constable, Arthur Griggs, hovered nearby, his jaw set with the stubbornness of Sussex clay. Griggs’s father had served under Fawkes, a fact Hesslewick filed away.

Mrs. Edith Fawkes, the widow, stood apart, her composure as carefully arranged as her mourning veil. She answered Hesslewick’s questions with chilly precision, denying any knowledge of the note or the missing effects. She admitted, with a flicker of irritation, that her late husband’s will had left her less than she’d hoped, but insisted she bore no grudge. She had been at home all night, she said, with the housemaid as witness.

Reverend Samuel Pritchard, who had discovered the note, wrung his hands as he recounted his early-morning routine. He had been in the vicarage all night, preparing his Sunday sermon, and claimed to have heard nothing. He spoke of Captain Fawkes with a measured respect, though Hesslewick detected a faint undercurrent of censure when the subject of the war arose.

Miss Ivy Larkin, the schoolteacher, was seen near the churchyard late the previous evening. She explained she had been gathering wildflowers for her classroom and had left before dusk. Her hands, Hesslewick noted, bore faint stains of earth. She spoke eagerly of her research into the village’s war records, but grew evasive when pressed about the note. She had been home, she said, reading, and her landlady could vouch for her presence after nine.

Mr. Harold Tewson, the groundskeeper, was summoned from his shed, where he was oiling a spade. He admitted to a quarrel with Fawkes over the state of the church roof, but dismissed it as nothing more than words. He had locked the gate at sundown, as always, and retired to his cottage by the lychgate. He claimed to have slept soundly, hearing nothing amiss. His boots, Hesslewick observed, were caked with dried mud.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick walked the churchyard, pausing by the grave. The footprints, he noted, were of varying sizes—one set larger, one smaller. The note, though anonymous, contained a phrase—"duty betrayed"—that echoed a remark he had heard earlier from Reverend Pritchard. Yet the vicar’s shoes were spotless, and his hands unmarked by soil.

A search of the grounds revealed nothing of the missing badge or effects. The only other oddity: a pressed wildflower, crushed into the mud near the grave, its petals bruised but recognisable as a species not found in the churchyard itself.

By noon, the villagers had drifted away, leaving Hesslewick alone with his thoughts and the restless crows. He closed his notebook, the puzzle unresolved but not unsolvable.

What, he wondered, had truly brought someone to disturb the peace of Captain Fawkes’s grave?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s solution hinges on two key observations: the wildflower and the timeline of alibis. The pressed wildflower found near the grave is not native to the churchyard but matches those found in the meadows where Miss Ivy Larkin was known to gather specimens. Ivy claimed to have left the churchyard before dusk, but the flower—freshly pressed into the mud—suggests she was present much later, likely after the groundskeeper had locked the gate. Furthermore, her hands bore traces of earth, inconsistent with her story of simply picking flowers earlier in the evening.

The footprints at the scene were of two sizes, but the smaller set matched Ivy’s shoes. The note’s language, while echoing the vicar’s rhetoric, was a deliberate red herring: Ivy, as an amateur historian, had access to the vicar’s sermons and war records, and could easily mimic his phrasing. The missing badge and effects were never found, but the motive was not theft for gain, but an attempt to expose—or perhaps avenge—a perceived betrayal from the war, uncovered in Ivy’s research.

Red herrings included the groundskeeper’s muddy boots (from his routine work), the widow’s resentment (which was financial, not personal), and the vicar’s critical remarks (which were moral, not actionable). Only Ivy had both the opportunity and the knowledge to stage the desecration and compose the note. Her slip was the wildflower, out of place and out of time, betraying her presence at the grave after hours.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-anchored in its 1937 rural English setting, with strong period detail and a consistent tone. The characters are distinct, each with plausible motives and alibis, and the village’s social dynamics are effectively sketched. The prose is tight, with unnecessary words trimmed, and the events unfold logically. The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle.

The clues are fairly presented: the wildflower, the muddy footprints, the note’s language, and the suspects’ alibis. The red herrings (the groundskeeper’s boots, the widow’s resentment, the vicar’s rhetoric) are convincing and do not feel forced. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle for the reader.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and deducible from the narrative. The wildflower and the timeline of alibis are the critical clues, and the reasoning connecting them to Miss Ivy Larkin is sound. The motive is plausible and fits the character’s background. The red herrings are addressed and resolved. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to detail and inference, particularly regarding the wildflower and the suspects’ movements. It is challenging but fair, with all necessary information present in the narrative.

No major inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative and solution are coherent, immersive, and satisfying for the genre.
