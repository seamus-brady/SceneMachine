## Narrative

The evening air in Thornley Garth was thick with the scent of bruised apples and the faint tang of rain. Behind the old orchard, the disused cider barn stood silent, its stone walls mottled with lichen and memory. On Thursday, 17th June 1937, Harold Fenwick—bookkeeper, stickler for detail, and lately a man with too many questions—was found dead, his head dashed against the ancient stone press.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived as the last of the sunset faded behind the hedgerows. PC Griggs had cordoned off the barn with twine and a look of discomfort. Inside, Fenwick lay beside the press, a torn ledger page near his hand, and the faint scuff of boots in the dust. There were signs of a struggle, but nothing to suggest a brawl—more a brief, desperate contest.

The cast assembled quickly. Edith Fenwick, pale and tight-lipped, had raised the alarm when her husband failed to return for supper. Thomas Liddell, the tenant farmer, arrived soon after, his boots muddy and his manner defensive. Agnes Partridge, treasurer of the Harvest Fund, appeared brisk and businesslike, her eyes flicking from the body to the ledger page. George Snaith, Liddell’s farmhand, lingered at the threshold, cap in hand, claiming to have seen someone leaving the barn but unable to say who.

Hesslewick began with the ledger. The torn page, half-smudged with cider lees, listed a series of payments—one, notably, to Liddell, larger than the rest. Agnes confirmed the accounts were in disarray, but insisted she’d only discovered the irregularities that afternoon. Liddell bristled at the implication, protesting that Fenwick had threatened to go to the parish council. Edith hovered by the door, her gaze fixed on her husband’s shoes as if they might walk home without him.

The timeline, as Hesslewick reconstructed it, was narrow. Fenwick was last seen alive at half past seven, arguing with Liddell near the orchard. Edith reported him missing at eight. Snaith claimed to have been mending a fence nearby, but his account was vague. Agnes said she’d been at home, preparing council papers, but no one could confirm it.

As the evening wore on, Hesslewick spoke quietly with each. Liddell insisted he’d left Fenwick alive, storming off after their quarrel. Agnes maintained she hadn’t left her cottage. Edith admitted she’d urged her husband to let the matter drop. Snaith, when pressed, said he’d seen a figure leaving the barn—"could’ve been anyone, sir, what with the light going and all."

A few details nagged at Hesslewick. The torn ledger page—why tear it out and leave it behind? Snaith’s boots, caked with mud, though the path to the barn was dry. Agnes’s gloves, immaculate despite her claim to have spent the afternoon sorting papers in her garden. Liddell’s hands, stained with something darker than soil. Edith’s insistence that Harold always locked the barn after himself, though the door had stood ajar.

By the time the moon rose over the orchard, Hesslewick had his answer. The villagers drifted home, uneasy and subdued, leaving the detective alone with the cider press and the ledger’s silent accusation.

What, in the end, betrayed the murderer?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The contradiction between Agnes Partridge’s account and the physical evidence is key. Agnes claimed she spent the afternoon sorting council papers in her garden, yet her gloves were spotless—impossible if she’d been handling papers outdoors after rain. The torn ledger page, half-smudged with cider lees, suggests it was torn out during the struggle. Only someone with prior access to the accounts and a motive to conceal their involvement would have reason to remove the page in haste.

Agnes, as treasurer, had both opportunity and motive. She arrived at the barn after Fenwick confronted Liddell, intending to retrieve incriminating evidence. Fenwick surprised her, leading to a brief struggle in which he was fatally injured. Agnes, in her haste, tore the ledger page but failed to take it with her. Her immaculate gloves—untouched by ink, cider, or mud—betrayed her: she had not been gardening or sorting papers, but had donned them only after the fact to avoid further incrimination. The behavioral slip, combined with the environmental mismatch, revealed her guilt. The red herrings—Liddell’s stained hands (from animal care), Snaith’s muddy boots (from another part of the farm), and Edith’s anxiety—were all explainable, but Agnes’s story did not fit the facts.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The prose is evocative without being overwrought, and the cast of suspects is introduced efficiently, each with plausible motives and distinct personalities. The timeline is clear, and the clues are embedded naturally in the narrative. The detective’s notes are immersive and maintain the story’s tone, summarizing the investigation’s key points without revealing the solution or tipping the reader toward it.

The puzzle is fair: the contradiction between Agnes’s statement and the state of her gloves is subtle but present, and the other suspects’ red herrings are plausible without being misleading. The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative, relying on careful reading and inference rather than obscure knowledge or trivial detail. The questions at the end are open-ended, inviting the reader to consider the evidence without leading them to the answer.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The only minor quibble is that the narrative could have provided a slightly clearer sense of the barn’s interior and the precise location of the struggle, but this does not detract from the solvability or enjoyment of the puzzle.

Difficulty: 7/10. The puzzle requires careful attention to detail and rewards close reading, but the solution is accessible to a thoughtful reader.
