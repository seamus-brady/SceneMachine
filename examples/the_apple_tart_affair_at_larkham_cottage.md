## Narrative

Larkham Cottage, with its sagging roof and riot of late-summer roses, had always looked as though it might one day host a scandal. On the evening in question, the scandal arrived in the form of Miss Edith Larkham’s sudden demise: her body discovered slumped at the supper table, a half-eaten slice of apple tart before her and a teacup cooling at her elbow. The village doctor, summoned by Mrs. Butterfield, pronounced her dead before the clock in the hall had struck nine. By morning, word had spread: arsenic, the sort kept for rats, had been found in the tart. The bottle from the garden shed was missing.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived with the dawn, his boots leaving neat prints in the dew. He found the household in a state of brittle civility. Harold Larkham, Edith’s younger brother, paced the parlour, his hands restless in his pockets. Mrs. Agnes Butterfield, neighbour and self-appointed guardian of village morals, hovered in the kitchen, offering tea and opinions. Mr. Percy Mott, the gardener, loitered by the orchard gate, his cap in his hands and his eyes on the ground. Miss Clara Finch, the quiet lodger, sat in the window seat, her book unopened in her lap.

Hesslewick began with the tart. The remains sat on a plate, the crust uneven where someone had cut hastily. The teapot, still half-full, gave off a faint scent of chamomile. He noted the absence of the rat poison bottle in the shed, the unfamiliar footprints at the back gate, and the faint trace of apple peelings in the kitchen bin.

He spoke first with Harold, who insisted he had arrived late, after the tart was baked, and had only argued with Edith about the estate. He claimed to have left before supper, storming out through the front door. Mrs. Butterfield, however, swore she saw him enter the cottage just after seven, and heard raised voices soon after. She had come by to return a borrowed book, but found the door locked and no answer to her knock.

Percy Mott, the gardener, admitted to being in the shed that afternoon, but insisted he’d left the poison untouched. He had been in the orchard at dusk, pruning the old Bramleys, and claimed not to have seen anyone near the back gate. He muttered about Edith’s temper and the recent threat to dismiss him.

Miss Finch, pale and composed, explained she had prepared tea for Edith as usual, but had not touched the tart. She had spent the evening in her room, reading, and only came down when she heard Mrs. Butterfield’s frantic cries. She seemed nervous, but her answers were precise. Hesslewick noted the faint scent of apple on her cuffs.

The detective walked the garden, pausing at the back gate where the footprints lingered in the soft earth. He measured them against the boots in the hall; none matched precisely. He examined the kitchen, noting the apple peelings and a single, clean paring knife in the sink. The bin contained the core of a Bramley apple, oddly fresh.

By midday, the household had settled into a tense silence. Hesslewick sat in the parlour, notebook open, watching the light shift across the carpet. He asked each person, in turn, to recount their movements. The stories overlapped, but not perfectly. Harold insisted he never entered the kitchen. Percy claimed he left the shed before dusk. Mrs. Butterfield maintained she saw Harold at the door, but could not say if he entered. Miss Finch, when pressed, admitted she had fetched apples from the orchard that afternoon, but insisted she left them on the kitchen table.

As the clock chimed two, Hesslewick closed his notebook. The clues were all present, if one only looked at them the right way. The question remained: who poisoned the tart, and how?

What detail has Hesslewick noticed that points to the truth?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the timeline and the apple peelings. Miss Finch claimed she fetched apples from the orchard and left them on the kitchen table, but the apple core in the bin was oddly fresh—suggesting someone prepared apples for the tart much later than claimed. The tart was supposedly baked before Harold arrived, but the presence of fresh peelings and a clean paring knife indicates the apples were prepared after his arrival. Miss Finch also had the scent of apple on her cuffs, though she claimed not to have touched the tart.

The real clue is the timing of the tart’s preparation. If the tart was made after Harold arrived, then his alibi is weakened. However, the footprints at the back gate do not match any of the household’s boots, suggesting a staged clue. Percy’s presence in the orchard is a red herring—he had no access to the kitchen that evening. Mrs. Butterfield’s testimony is unreliable, as she did not see Harold enter, only approach.

Miss Finch, as the only one who prepared tea and had access to the kitchen, had both opportunity and means. The arsenic was likely added to the tart during its late preparation, not earlier in the day. Her nervousness, precise answers, and the scent of apple on her cuffs betray her involvement. The contradiction between her claimed timeline and the freshness of the apple core is what led Hesslewick to the truth: Miss Finch poisoned the tart, taking advantage of the confusion over the evening’s events and the household’s focus on Harold’s argument with Edith.

## Analysis

Review of Narrative and Solution:

Narrative:
The narrative is atmospheric, well-paced, and evocative of a 1930s English village. The setting and characterisation are consistent with the period, and the prose is tight, with unnecessary words and phrases removed. The suspects are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the clues are woven naturally into the story. The detective’s methodical approach is in keeping with Hesslewick’s established character. The narrative maintains the puzzle element, offering enough information for a careful reader to deduce the solution without giving it away. The open-ended question at the end preserves the challenge.

Solution:
The solution is logical and fair. The deduction hinges on the freshness of the apple core and peelings, the timeline of the tart’s preparation, and the scent of apple on Miss Finch’s cuffs. These clues are present in the narrative but not highlighted in a way that spoils the puzzle. The staged footprints and unreliable testimonies add plausible misdirection. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure; it rewards close reading and careful attention to detail. All elements are consistent with the narrative and setting.

Inconsistencies or Errors:
There are no major inconsistencies or errors. The only minor point is that the freshness of apple peelings and core as a clue requires the reader to infer how quickly apples oxidise, but this is reasonable for the time period and setting. The presence of the scent of apple on Miss Finch’s cuffs is a subtle but fair clue.

Difficulty Level: 7/10
The puzzle is moderately challenging, requiring careful attention to timelines and physical evidence, but all necessary information is present for a determined reader to solve it.
