## Narrative

Scene One: The Orchard at Dusk

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the overgrown orchard behind the disused Methodist chapel as the last of the evening light faded from the Sussex sky. The grass was knee-high, tangled with nettles and the remnants of last year’s apples. PC Griggs, broad and red-faced, stood by the battered orchard ladder, his helmet in his hands. Mrs. Liddle, Thornley Garth’s chronicler of calamity, hovered nearby, her hat askew and her eyes bright with the thrill of tragedy.

Arthur Pelling’s body lay beneath the gnarled branches, a single blow to the head. The ladder—old, heavy, and flecked with lichen—rested a few feet away. George Ticehurst, pale and trembling, sat on an upturned crate, watched by Griggs. Edwin Pelling, Arthur’s younger brother, lingered at the orchard’s edge, his crutch sinking into the soft earth.

Scene Two: The Statements

Hesslewick began with George, who confessed at once. “We argued, yes. About Edwin, about the accident. I lost my head. I struck him with the ladder. I didn’t mean—”

Hesslewick’s gaze was steady. “Why here, George? The orchard is hardly a meeting place.”

George’s eyes flickered. “Arthur asked me to meet him. Said he wanted to settle things. I came. We argued. I snapped.”

Mrs. Liddle interjected, “I saw George heading this way just before seven. I was out for my constitutional. Arthur was already here, I think. I heard voices—raised, but I couldn’t make out words.”

Edwin, when pressed, said little. “Arthur left the cottage after tea. Said he needed air. I didn’t see him again.”

PC Griggs added, “No one else seen near the orchard, sir. Only Mrs. Liddle, and she’s not the type.”

Scene Three: The Orchard and the Ladder

Hesslewick paced the scene, notebook in hand. The grass was trampled in a rough arc near the body. The ladder, though heavy, bore no fresh marks: no blood, no hair. The orchard’s isolation meant no easy way in or out but the narrow path from chapel lane. He asked Griggs to check for footprints, though the grass would yield little.

Scene Four: The Interviews

Mrs. Liddle, in her kitchen, offered tea and a running commentary on village affairs. “Arthur was troubled, you know. Never quite the same after Edwin’s accident. And George—well, he’s always been quick to temper. But I can’t see him as a killer. Not really.”

Edwin, at home, was withdrawn. “Arthur blamed himself for what happened to me. George did too, in his way. They were friends once.” He hesitated. “I heard shouting from the orchard. I thought it best not to interfere.”

George, in the constable’s care, repeated his confession. “I did it. I deserve whatever comes.”

Scene Five: The Detective’s Walk

Hesslewick walked the orchard again, this time with Edwin. The younger man struggled with the uneven ground. “You didn’t come here often?” Hesslewick asked.

“Not since the accident. Too difficult.”

Hesslewick nodded, watching Edwin’s progress. “And Arthur—did he ever mention meeting George here before?”

Edwin shook his head. “No. He hated the orchard. Reminded him of that day.”

Scene Six: The Puzzle

Back at the chapel gate, Hesslewick reviewed his notes. George’s confession was oddly convenient. The orchard, rarely visited, was an unlikely spot for a spontaneous quarrel. The ladder, heavy and awkward, seemed an improbable weapon for a crime of passion. Yet the village was content to let the matter rest—except for Hesslewick, who disliked untidy endings.

He gathered the group beneath the chapel’s crumbling arch. “There is something about this evening that does not fit,” he said quietly. “Something that troubles me.”

What has Hesslewick noticed that everyone else has missed?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in the physical impossibility of George’s confession. George claims to have struck Arthur with the heavy orchard ladder during a heated argument. However, the ladder is extremely cumbersome—awkward for a single person to wield as a weapon, especially in the overgrown grass. More importantly, the ladder bore no fresh marks: no blood, no hair, no sign of recent violence. If George had used it to strike Arthur, there would be some evidence on the ladder itself.

Additionally, the orchard is an unlikely place for a spontaneous confrontation. Both Arthur and George had little reason to be there, and Edwin confirms Arthur avoided the orchard due to painful memories. The only person with a plausible reason to be in the orchard—despite his disability—is Edwin, who could have lured Arthur there under false pretenses, knowing his brother would not refuse him.

The real clue is Edwin’s knowledge: he claims to have heard shouting from the orchard, but his cottage is too far for voices to carry clearly, especially with the wind in the wrong direction that evening (a detail Hesslewick noted from the way the grass was bent). This suggests Edwin was closer to the scene than he admits. His motive is complex—resentment and guilt over his accident, and perhaps a desire to end the cycle of blame between Arthur and George.

In sum: George’s confession is a red herring, born of guilt over the past. The physical evidence (or lack thereof) on the ladder, combined with Edwin’s inconsistent statement and the implausibility of the orchard as a meeting place, point to Edwin as the true perpetrator. He staged the scene to implicate George, knowing the village would accept a simple story over a complicated truth.

## Analysis

Review of Narrative:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in its 1937 Sussex village setting. The characters are distinct, and the dialogue is consistent with the period. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the reader to absorb the details and personalities without rushing to the solution. The scenes are tightly constructed, and the inclusion of the detective’s walk and interviews deepens immersion. The narrative avoids anachronisms and maintains a tone appropriate to the era.

The detective’s notes are structured, neutral, and preserve the puzzle. The suspect list is clean, focusing on roles and personalities rather than clues. The narrative does not tip the reader toward the solution, and the open-ended question at the end maintains the puzzle’s integrity.

Review of Solution:

The solution is logical and deducible from the narrative. The physical impossibility of George’s confession, the lack of evidence on the ladder, and the inconsistencies in Edwin’s statements are all present in the story, allowing a careful reader to reach the correct conclusion. The motive is plausible, and the red herring of George’s confession is well-executed. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to physical evidence and statements, making it moderately challenging but fair. The clues are subtle but present, and the solution rewards close reading without relying on obscure knowledge or leaps of logic.
