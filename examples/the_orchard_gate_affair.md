## Narrative

It was the sort of June night that made Thornley Garth’s hedgerows seem almost conspiratorial, the moonlight pooling in the hollows behind the old Wainwright orchard. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, summoned from his cottage by a breathless PC Griggs, found the scene as he expected: a body, a bottle, and a village already fermenting with speculation.

Arthur “Artie” Munday lay beside the disused apple press, his head bloodied, his boots caked in orchard mud. The press itself, rusted and unused since the last good harvest, loomed over him like a relic of better times. A half-empty bottle of cider rested on its side, its contents seeping into the grass. The orchard gate, usually chained, hung open. A single muddy footprint, not matching Artie’s boots, marked the earth nearby.

Mrs. Edith Wainwright, owner of the orchard and finder of the body, stood with her arms folded, her terrier at her heels. She had discovered Artie after her dog began barking at the open gate. “I told him, no visitors after dark,” she said, her voice clipped. “But Artie never did listen.”

George Liddell, a card player with a nervous habit of smoothing his moustache, hovered by the fence. He admitted to arguing with Artie at the Hare & Hounds earlier that night. “He was pressing me for money,” George muttered. “Loud enough for half the pub to hear. But I left him there. I’ve my own troubles.”

Tommy Griggs, the constable’s son, lingered at the orchard’s edge, hands in his pockets. “Saw Artie and George at the pub,” he said. “Left before them, I did. Walked home past the orchard, but didn’t see anyone about. Swear it.”

Hesslewick walked the scene, notebook in hand. He noted the cider bottle, the gate, the footprint. He asked Mrs. Wainwright about the gate. “Locked at dusk, as always,” she replied. “Only I and the boy—Tommy—have keys. But anyone could hop the fence, I suppose.”

He questioned George about his boots. George showed them: clean, polished, unsuitable for mud. “Didn’t set foot in the orchard,” he insisted. “I went straight home.”

Tommy’s boots, by contrast, were muddy. “From helping Mrs. Wainwright earlier,” he explained. “Carried sacks to the press. Went home after the pub, honest.”

Hesslewick asked about the cider. Mrs. Wainwright frowned. “Not mine. I keep my cellar locked. Artie must have brought it himself.”

As the night deepened, the village grew quieter, but the orchard seemed to hold its breath. Hesslewick lingered, considering the muddy footprint, the open gate, the bottle, and the stories that almost—but not quite—fit together.

He gathered the three in the farmhouse kitchen, the dog snoring under the table, and asked each to recount their movements once more. The answers were the same, but something in the pattern was off—a detail that, once noticed, could not be ignored.

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s attention settled on the muddy footprint by the apple press. It did not match Artie’s boots, nor George’s clean shoes. Tommy’s boots were muddy, but he claimed the mud was from earlier in the day, helping Mrs. Wainwright. However, Tommy also said he left the pub before Artie and George and walked home past the orchard, seeing no one. Yet, the orchard gate was left ajar and the footprint was fresh—still wet in the cool night air when the body was found. If Tommy had truly walked home before the others, the mud on his boots would have dried, and he would not have left a fresh, wet print at the scene. Furthermore, only Mrs. Wainwright and Tommy had keys to the gate, and Mrs. Wainwright insisted she had locked it at dusk. The open gate and the footprint both pointed to someone with access after dark—Tommy. The cider bottle, a red herring, distracted from the real clue: the timing of the footprint. Tommy’s alibi was undone by the freshness of the mud. He had returned to the orchard after leaving the pub, encountered Artie, and in the ensuing altercation, struck the fatal blow. The contradiction between Tommy’s claimed timeline and the physical evidence revealed his guilt.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 rural English setting, with strong characterisation and a clear sense of place. The puzzle is fair: the key clue is the freshness of the muddy footprint, which contradicts Tommy’s alibi. The suspects are presented neutrally, and the detective’s notes add immersion without spoiling the solution. The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative, relying on the reader’s attention to the timeline and physical evidence. The cider bottle serves as a plausible red herring. The only minor weakness is that the freshness of mud is a subtle clue, and some readers may wish for a slightly broader range of physical evidence or motive. However, the puzzle is neither trivial nor unsolvable, and the difficulty is moderate. The open-ended question at the end preserves the puzzle element. Overall, this is a strong, classic cosy crime puzzle.
