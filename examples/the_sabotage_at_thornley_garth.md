## Narrative

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at Thornley Garth’s apple barn just after midnight, summoned by a breathless PC Griggs and the village’s collective sense of outrage. The barn, usually redolent of apples and yeast, now stank of petrol and panic. Alfred Pargeter, orchard owner and recent victor in the Brighton contract wars, lay on a makeshift cot, his head bandaged, his right arm splinted. The apple press loomed in the gloom, its gears glistening with something darker than cider.

Edith Pargeter, Alfred’s sister, hovered by the barn door, arms folded, lips pursed so tightly they might never open again. Mabel Griggs, the schoolteacher, stood near the cider barrels, her spectacles fogged and her notebook clutched like a shield. Samuel Hodge, rival orchardist and recent bankrupt, paced outside, boots leaving muddy crescents on the chalk. Len Carter, the village’s indispensable mechanic, leaned against the wall, hands stained with oil, eyes darting between the press and the people.

Hesslewick began with the scene. The wire, strung at shin-height across the threshold, was the sort kept in the barn’s tool cupboard. The press’s safety catch had been wedged open with a splinter of wood. Petrol had been sloshed over the floorboards, but not ignited. Muddy footprints—several sets—led out toward the chalk road. Alfred’s watch was missing, though his wallet remained. The barn’s clock, stopped at 10:17, ticked no more.

He questioned Edith first. She claimed to have been in the kitchen, preparing tea for her brother, and insisted she’d heard nothing until the commotion. Her apron was spotless, her hands less so. She bristled at the mention of Alfred’s business dealings. “He’s stubborn, but not a fool,” she said. “He wouldn’t have left the barn unlocked.”

Samuel Hodge, when pressed, admitted to walking past the orchard on his way home from the pub. “Saw the light in the barn, thought nothing of it. Why would I? I’ve no business with Alfred now.” His boots, Hesslewick noted, were caked with the same chalky mud as the footprints. Samuel’s alibi—home alone, reading the Argus—was uncorroborated.

Mabel Griggs, nervous but composed, said she’d been grading papers in her cottage. She’d heard a crash and hurried over, arriving just after Edith. “I saw Len running from the direction of the barn,” she added, almost apologetically. “He looked…frightened.”

Len Carter, summoned from the tractor shed, said he’d been repairing Farmer Willet’s tractor all evening. “Didn’t leave till near half ten. Stopped by the barn to fetch a spanner I’d left. Found Alfred on the floor, bleeding. Ran for help.” His overalls were flecked with grease and something that might have been cider. He produced the spanner, but it was clean.

Hesslewick walked the barn again, noting the wire’s placement, the petrol’s pungency, the missing watch. He asked Edith about the household finances. She stiffened. “Alfred keeps his own counsel. I see to the bills, nothing more.”

The detective lingered by the apple press, tracing the sabotage. The wire was expertly tied, the safety catch wedged just so. Not the work of an amateur. He asked Len about the tools. “Anyone could’ve taken wire from the cupboard,” Len replied. “But not everyone knows how to rig a press.”

As dawn crept over the orchard, Hesslewick gathered the villagers. “Someone here knows more than they’ve said. The footprints, the wire, the petrol—none of it accidental.” He paused, letting the silence settle. “But one detail does not fit.”

What has Inspector Hesslewick realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s breakthrough comes from the muddy footprints and the missing watch. Samuel Hodge’s boots match the mud, but that is expected—he admits to passing the orchard. The real clue is the stopped barn clock at 10:17. Len claims he found Alfred and ran for help after finishing work at half past ten, but if the clock stopped during the struggle, Alfred was attacked before 10:17. Len could not have found Alfred after half past ten unless he was lying about his timeline. Furthermore, Len’s knowledge of the press’s sabotage—specifically, how the safety catch was wedged—was too detailed for someone who supposedly only found the aftermath. Only someone who tampered with the press would know exactly how it was rigged. The petrol, a red herring, was meant to suggest arson, but the true intent was to make the accident look fatal. The missing watch was taken to confuse the timeline. Len, with his mechanical skill and access, is the only one who could have set the trap and then manipulated his story to fit the discovery. Hesslewick deduces that Len sabotaged the press before 10:17, left muddy footprints as he departed, and returned later to "find" Alfred, hoping to deflect suspicion. The contradiction in Len’s timeline and his knowledge of the sabotage reveal his guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and well-rooted in the 1937 rural English setting. The characters are distinct, with clear roles and plausible motives. The clues are presented naturally through Hesslewick’s investigation, and the dialogue is consistent with the period. The addition of the detective’s notes deepens immersion and provides a structured summary without spoiling the puzzle.

The puzzle is well-constructed: the timeline, the stopped clock, the muddy footprints, and the mechanical knowledge required for the sabotage are all logical clues. The red herring of the petrol is effective, and the missing watch adds complexity to the timeline. The suspects’ statements are believable and do not overtly tip the reader toward the solution.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains a tight focus on the investigation. The open-ended question at the end invites the reader to deduce the solution without leading them.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Len’s timeline, his mechanical expertise, and his detailed knowledge of the sabotage are all fair clues. The use of the stopped clock as a key to the timeline is classic but effective. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

There are no major inconsistencies or errors. All clues are accounted for, and the suspects’ roles are clear. The only minor suggestion would be to clarify the timing of when the clock stopped, but this is implied well enough for a careful reader.

Difficulty Level: 7/10

This puzzle requires careful attention to detail and logical deduction, making it moderately challenging but fair for experienced readers.
