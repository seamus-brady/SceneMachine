## Narrative

The September wind rattled the loose slates of the Tilley barn, carrying the scent of apples and the faint tang of the sea. Inspector Rupert Hesslewick, coat buttoned to the throat, stood by the battered door and surveyed the scene with the air of a man who had seen too many barns and far too many secrets.

The barn itself was unremarkable: a sagging relic, half-swallowed by brambles, with the old apple press crouched in the gloom like a guilty accomplice. The morning’s discovery had drawn a small, uneasy crowd: Tom Tilley, gaunt and red-eyed; Elsie, silent and watchful; Mabel Griggs, arms folded and lips pursed; Arthur Pike, bus driver’s cap in hand, shifting from foot to foot; and PC Griggs, who looked as if he’d rather be anywhere else.

The crime was simple, at least on the surface. The hidden cache—French brandy and American cigarettes, smuggled in to support young Elsie—had vanished overnight. The barn door had been forced, muddy footprints led away toward the cliff path, and a torn bus ticket lay near the apple press. Several villagers claimed to have seen lantern light near the barn, but no one agreed on who had been there.

Hesslewick began with Tom. The uncle’s hands trembled as he recounted his efforts to keep Elsie from being sent away, his voice thick with guilt and fatigue. He claimed to have been at home all night, nursing a cold and a bottle of cough syrup. Elsie, pale and self-contained, said she’d slept through the commotion, though her shoes bore a faint trace of mud. Mabel Griggs, brisk and unsentimental, insisted she’d seen Arthur Pike’s lantern bobbing near the barn around midnight, but Arthur denied it, claiming he’d been home, reading the racing results by lamplight. PC Griggs, for his part, had been on patrol, though his route was vague and his memory vaguer still.

Hesslewick walked the barn, notebook in hand. The footprints were muddled—at least two sets, one smaller than the other. The torn bus ticket was curious: the date was yesterday, but the time was late, after the last bus had left Thornley Garth. He pocketed it, saying nothing.

He questioned each in turn. Tom’s story never wavered, but he flinched when asked about the bus schedule. Elsie, when pressed, admitted she’d heard voices in the night but couldn’t say whose. Mabel grew defensive when asked about her husband’s whereabouts. Arthur, usually garrulous, grew silent when the subject of debts arose. PC Griggs, asked about the lantern, insisted he’d seen nothing, but Hesslewick noted the faint smell of tobacco on his coat—French, not English.

As the afternoon waned, Hesslewick gathered them by the apple press. He recited the facts, his tone mild, almost bored. The footprints, the lantern, the bus ticket, the missing cache. He watched their faces, not for guilt, but for fear.

He closed his notebook with a snap. “One of you knows more than you’re saying. The question is not who could have taken the goods, but who could have left the evidence behind.”

He let the silence stretch, the wind rattling the barn door. “The answer,” he said, “is in the details you’ve all overlooked.”

Why does Inspector Hesslewick suspect Arthur Pike? What detail in the evidence does not fit? What has the detective realized?

## Solution (Answer Key)

Inspector Hesslewick’s suspicion falls on Arthur Pike due to the torn bus ticket. The ticket is dated for yesterday, but the time printed on it is after the last bus had left Thornley Garth. Only the bus driver—Arthur—could have issued a ticket at that hour, and only he would have access to blank tickets. The ticket was meant to implicate someone else, but in fact, it points to Arthur’s unique position.

Furthermore, Arthur’s alibi—reading the racing results by lamplight—cannot be verified, and his silence regarding his debts is telling. The lantern sighting is a red herring; several villagers own lanterns, and the footprints are muddled enough to confuse the issue. The real clue is the bus ticket: its existence at the scene, with an impossible time, is something only the bus driver could have manufactured.

Hesslewick deduces that Arthur, in debt and desperate, stole the cache and tried to frame another by planting the ticket. The sabotage of the hiding place was to ensure suspicion fell on Tom, but the detail of the ticket’s timing is the logical inconsistency that reveals Arthur’s guilt.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is atmospheric and tightly written, with strong period detail and a clear sense of place. The characters are distinct and their motivations plausible, fitting the social dynamics of a 1937 English village. The clues are presented fairly, with the torn bus ticket serving as the central puzzle element. The detective’s method is consistent with his established character, and the suspects’ personalities and roles are well-drawn without tipping the reader toward the solution.

The narrative avoids unnecessary exposition and maintains coherence with the time period. The open-ended questions at the end preserve the puzzle’s integrity, inviting the reader to deduce the answer without leading them.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and satisfying, hinging on a detail (the bus ticket’s impossible time) that is both fair and deducible from the narrative. The reasoning is sound: only Arthur, as the bus driver, could have produced a ticket after the last bus, and his motive (debts) is established without being overemphasized. The red herrings (lantern, footprints, tobacco) are plausible and do not distract from the core clue. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty:

I would rate the difficulty as 6 out of 10. The puzzle requires careful attention to detail but is solvable with close reading. The central clue is subtle but fair, and the narrative provides enough information for a reader to deduce the answer without external knowledge.

Overall, this is a well-constructed and immersive cosy crime puzzle, with a logical solution and a satisfying level of challenge.
