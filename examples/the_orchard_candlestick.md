## Narrative

The orchard behind the vicarage was not a place for early risers, but Mrs. Edith Hargreaves, the vicar’s housekeeper, preferred the company of chickens to that of people. On the morning of June 14th, 1937, she found more than eggs beneath the apple boughs: Mr. Lionel Pritchard, retired solicitor and recent London transplant, lay sprawled on the damp grass, his skull caved in by a heavy brass candlestick. His pockets were turned out, his spectacles askew, and the orchard’s silence was broken only by the distant clucking of hens.

Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived before the dew had burned off, his gait slow but unyielding. He surveyed the scene with the air of a man who had seen too many bodies in unlikely places. The candlestick, unmistakably from the disused vicarage, lay a few feet from the corpse. Rain had muddied the ground, erasing any hope of clear footprints.

PC Griggs, summoned from his breakfast, hovered at the orchard’s edge, notebook in hand, while Hesslewick began his quiet circuit. The orchard was bounded by hedgerows and the vicarage wall; access was possible from the lane, the vicarage garden, or the field beyond. The murder could not have gone unnoticed for long.

Hesslewick called the principal villagers to the vicarage’s parlour. Mrs. Hargreaves, hands red from scrubbing, recounted her discovery with distress and composure. She had come to feed the chickens at dawn and found Mr. Pritchard already dead. She had not seen or heard anyone else in the orchard.

Mr. Arthur Bellamy, the local farmer, arrived with mud on his boots and a wary set to his jaw. He admitted to a quarrel with Pritchard two days prior—about land boundaries—but insisted he had been milking cows at the time of the murder. His wife, he said, could vouch for him, though she was not present.

Miss Clara Finch, the schoolteacher, sat by the window, her hands folded tight. She acknowledged a heated conversation with Pritchard the previous afternoon, concerning a ‘private matter’ she declined to specify. She claimed to have spent the morning preparing lessons in her cottage, which overlooked the orchard, but said she had not seen or heard anything unusual.

Reverend Samuel Hargreaves, the vicar, entered last, his collar slightly askew. He expressed shock and sorrow, but Hesslewick noted the vicar’s protectiveness—both of his housekeeper and the village’s reputation. The candlestick, he confirmed, had been left in the vicarage’s disused study for years. He had been in his study at the time of the murder, writing Sunday’s sermon, and had not left the house until summoned by Mrs. Hargreaves.

Hesslewick walked the orchard again, noting the absence of footprints and the neatness of the scene. He questioned each villager in turn, probing for inconsistencies. Bellamy’s boots were muddy, but the orchard’s grass was only lightly trampled. Miss Finch’s cottage window, though facing the orchard, was closed and curtained. Mrs. Hargreaves, though shaken, seemed almost too composed. The vicar was eager to steer conversation away from the vicarage’s past.

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick’s questions grew more precise. Why had Pritchard’s pockets been turned out, yet nothing taken? Why had the candlestick been chosen as a weapon, when stones and branches were plentiful? Why had no one seen or heard anything, in a village where curtains twitch at the slightest disturbance?

At last, Hesslewick gathered the villagers beneath the orchard’s dripping boughs. He recited the facts, his voice as dry as the chalk road. The murder, he said, was not a crime of passion, but of calculation. The clues were subtle, but damning.

What detail in the suspects’ stories does not fit? What has Inspector Hesslewick realized about the morning’s events?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key lies in Miss Clara Finch’s alibi. She claimed to have spent the morning preparing lessons in her cottage, which overlooks the orchard, but said she saw and heard nothing unusual. However, the murder occurred in the open orchard, and the village is known for its vigilance—especially from windows facing the scene. The rain had stopped before dawn, and the orchard was visible from her window. If she had truly been at her desk, she could not have failed to notice the commotion of Mrs. Hargreaves discovering the body, or the arrival of the inspector and PC Griggs. Her claim to have seen nothing is implausible.

Furthermore, the closed and curtained window suggests she was not in the room at all. Miss Finch’s argument with Pritchard the previous day, concerning a ‘private matter,’ provides motive. The absence of footprints is explained by the rain and by Miss Finch’s careful approach via the vicarage garden, where the grass was less muddy. She took the candlestick from the disused study, confronted Pritchard in the orchard, and killed him. She turned out his pockets searching for incriminating material, then returned to her cottage, drawing the curtains to avoid being seen.

Hesslewick deduced her guilt from the environmental mismatch: her alibi required her to have witnessed events she claimed not to have seen. The other suspects’ stories, while suspicious, did not contain this contradiction. Miss Finch’s knowledge—what she did not see—was the detail that gave her away.

## Analysis

The narrative is atmospheric, tightly written, and consistent with the 1937 rural English village setting. The characters are well-drawn, and the clues are embedded naturally in dialogue and observation. The detective’s notes add structure and immersion, summarizing the key facts and suspects without revealing the solution or biasing the reader.

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The contradiction in Miss Finch’s alibi is subtle but fair; her claim not to have seen or heard anything, despite her vantage point and the village’s usual vigilance, is the critical flaw. The motive and opportunity are plausible, and the explanation for the lack of footprints is reasonable given the weather and geography described.

The questions at the end of the narrative are open-ended and do not lead the reader to the solution, preserving the puzzle element.

Difficulty Level: 7/10. The puzzle is challenging but fair, requiring close attention to alibis and environmental details. The solution is not immediately obvious but is satisfying once deduced.

No significant inconsistencies or errors were found. The narrative, clues, and solution are coherent and well-integrated.
