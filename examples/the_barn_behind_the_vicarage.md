## Narrative

It was a morning of fog and frost when Inspector Rupert Hesslewick arrived at the old Lavington barn, summoned by PC Griggs’s agitated knock. The barn, behind the vicarage orchard, appeared as innocent as a hymnbook. Yet inside, among sacks of feed, lay crates of French brandy and silk stockings—contraband of a distinctly uncharitable nature.

Mrs. Edith Lavington, owner of both barn and reputation, stood at the threshold, her gloved hands folded. “I assure you, Inspector, I know nothing of these foreign goods. I keep the barn locked, always.”

Griggs, red-faced and wheezing, recounted his night patrol. “Saw a lantern bobbing in the fog, sir. Heard a boat engine out at sea. When I checked the barn at dawn, it was locked tight. Only these boot prints—unfamiliar, I’d say—leading to the cart track.”

Hesslewick nodded, making a note. The barn’s lock was old but serviceable, the key kept by Mrs. Lavington. Harold Pym, the grocer, delivered feed weekly and knew the layout well. He arrived, cap in hand, eyes darting. “I just bring the sacks, sir. Never seen those crates before. I was home last night—my wife can vouch.”

Miss Clara Fenwick, the schoolteacher, appeared next, her coat dusted with orchard blossom. “I sometimes walk here to clear my head. I saw nothing—only the fog. I was reading at home by nine.”

Reverend Lionel March, tall and grave, joined them, keyring glinting. “The parish funds are stretched, Inspector. I’ve urged Mrs. Lavington to let the barn to summer visitors, but she refused. I was at the vicarage all evening, preparing Sunday’s sermon.”

Hesslewick walked the barn’s perimeter, noting the boot prints—one set, larger than Griggs’s own. He examined the lock: no sign of force. The crates were stacked behind the feed, not visible from the door. A lantern, half-full of oil, sat on a beam. Hesslewick sniffed: the wick was cold.

He questioned each again. Mrs. Lavington insisted she’d locked up at dusk. Pym repeated his alibi, adding, “If I’d known, I’d have told you, sir. I can’t afford trouble.” Clara, eyes wary, mentioned her recent trip to France. “But I brought back only books and chocolates.” The Reverend, hands folded, said, “I trust my flock, Inspector. But temptation is everywhere.”

As the morning wore on, Hesslewick watched the interplay: Mrs. Lavington’s nervous glances, Pym’s anxious fidgeting, Clara’s careful silences, the Reverend’s measured calm. He asked about the lantern. Mrs. Lavington said it was hers, for emergencies. Pym claimed he’d never used it. Clara said she disliked the smell of oil. The Reverend remarked, “I prefer candles. Lanterns are too modern for my taste.”

Hesslewick paused, then asked, “Who else has a key to the barn?” Mrs. Lavington hesitated. “Only myself. Though Harold sometimes borrows it to deliver feed.”

By noon, the fog had lifted, but the mystery remained. The barn was locked from the outside, the goods hidden, the prints leading away. Yet something in the stories did not fit. Hesslewick closed his notebook, eyes narrowing. He addressed the group:

“One of you knows more than you admit. The answer lies not in what was seen, but in what could not have been. Consider carefully: who could have locked the barn from the outside, and why would they need to?”

He left the question hanging, as the villagers shifted uneasily in the pale April sun.

Questions:

Who had the opportunity to access the barn without leaving obvious traces?
What motive might drive someone to risk bringing contraband into the village?
How might the barn have been locked from the outside without attracting attention?
What significance lies in the lantern found unused inside the barn?

## Solution (Answer Key)

The key to the puzzle is the locked barn. The goods were discovered after a foggy night, the barn locked from the outside, and only Mrs. Lavington (and occasionally Harold Pym) had access to the key. The unfamiliar boot prints suggest someone from outside the regular circle, but the lock shows no sign of force, and the lantern wick is cold, indicating it was not used recently.

The crucial clue is the Reverend’s statement: "I prefer candles. Lanterns are too modern for my taste." Yet, the lantern in the barn is half-full of oil and sits on a beam, suggesting it was placed there by someone familiar with the barn’s interior—someone who would not need to use it to see, because they already knew the layout. The Reverend claims to have been at the vicarage all evening, but the vicarage and barn share the same grounds, and he has keys to both. His motive is parish funds, and his knowledge of the barn’s arrangement is clear from his suggestion to let it to visitors.

The red herrings are Clara’s French trip (suggesting she might have smuggled the goods herself), Pym’s financial troubles, and the unfamiliar boot prints (which could have been made by borrowed boots or deliberately misleading). Mrs. Lavington’s nervousness is that of a woman worried about scandal, not guilt.

The real clue is the Reverend’s unnecessary comment about lanterns—he distances himself from the object, but only someone who had been in the barn that night would know the lantern was there and unused. He locked the barn from the outside after hiding the goods, using his own key, and left the prints to suggest an outsider. The contradiction between his supposed unfamiliarity with the barn’s contents and his knowledge of the lantern gives him away.

## Analysis

Narrative Review:

The narrative is well-constructed, atmospheric, and consistent with the 1937 rural English setting. The prose is tight, with unnecessary words and phrases removed. The suspects are introduced with clear roles and personalities, and the clues are embedded naturally in dialogue and observation. The detective’s notes are integrated in a manner that deepens immersion without spoiling the puzzle or leading the reader to the solution. The open-ended questions at the end encourage reader engagement without hinting at the answer.

The story maintains coherence and period accuracy, with details such as the fog, the lantern, and the social dynamics of the village fitting the era. The suspects’ motives and alibis are plausible, and the interplay between them is believable. The puzzle element is preserved, with no overt clues or contradictions given away in the notes or narrative.

Solution Review:

The solution is logical and can be deduced from the narrative. The key deduction hinges on the Reverend’s unnecessary distancing from the lantern, which only someone with direct knowledge of the barn’s interior would make. The locked-room aspect is handled well, with the explanation relying on access to the key and familiarity with the barn. Red herrings are present but not overwhelming, and the motives are credible. The solution is neither trivial nor overly obscure, striking a good balance for a cosy crime puzzle.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

The puzzle requires careful attention to dialogue and subtle inconsistencies, making it moderately challenging but fair. The clues are present but require thoughtful deduction, suitable for readers familiar with the genre.
